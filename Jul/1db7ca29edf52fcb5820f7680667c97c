The Pretoria high court has ordered that investigations into the kidnapping and murder of Hillary Gardee be prioritised. It  ordered that a multidisciplinary team comprising of  SAPS,  crime intelligence and  Hawks officers be  appointed to  investigate, inspect, search and collect  evidence. The team is to keep the Gardee family informed of developments every two weeks. The family brought an urgent application to compel the police and minister of police Bheki Cele to prioritise the investigation. The matter was heard in camera due to sensitive evidence of “persons of interest” annexed to the papers. The family argued that the court should compel the  police  to hand over the docket to the Hawks, who have the  skills  and  technology  to investigate  the case. Family spokesperson Sinawo Tambo  said the relief granted by the court  was a  victory for citizens in the battle against gender-based violence and  a  reminder of the constitutional obligation of the SAPS to serve  citizens. “In this regard, the first meeting between the family‘s representatives,  advocate Gillian Benson and  advocate Lawrence Mrwebi, with the multidisciplinary team will be scheduled at the earliest convenience with  [the police] team,” Tambo said.
