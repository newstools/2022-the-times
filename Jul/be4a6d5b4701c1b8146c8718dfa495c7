Annual consumer inflation jumped to 7.4% in June from 6.5% in May, mainly driven by rising transport and food prices. Stats SA said on Wednesday the annual rate rose during 2021 and continued its upward trajectory in the first half of 2022. Many countries around the globe have experienced rising inflation in recent months, making it a hot topic for debate, particularly in the area of monetary policy. Prices of food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 8.6% year-on-year in June. This is the highest annual rate for food and beverages since March 2017 when the country was recovering from severe drought. The main groups contributing to high food inflation were bread and cereals, meat and oils and fats. Bread and cereal products recorded an annual rate of 11.2%, up from 8.4% in May. The monthly increase was 2.6% with notable price rises for maize meal (5.2%), brown bread (3.2%) and macaroni (3%).
