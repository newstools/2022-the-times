A state witness in the rape trial of Bishop Stephen Bafana Zondo is on Monday expected to testify in camera. This is as the trial resumes  in the Pretoria high court. The Rivers of Living Waters Ministries head is accused of raping seven women and trying to bribe one into dropping a case. Outside court two groups have gathered, one in support of Zondo and the other against. The groups stood a few  metres apart while singing and holding placards. Zondo faces 10 charges  including rape,  indecent assault  and defeating the ends of justice. TimesLIVE previously reported that one  victim was a minor when the alleged rape happened. She claimed Zondo had repeatedly raped her in the 1980s in Sebokeng. An indictment submitted to the court alleged that in May 2020 he had tried to bribe her into dropping the case with an offer of R25,000. A second victim was allegedly raped by Zondo at a Johannesburg hotel in 2008. Another was allegedly raped by Zondo at his church premises, while  others reported  alleged rapes in Evaton between 2013 and 2018. Zondo and his congregants have vehemently denied the allegations and claimed  they are a smear campaign aimed at discrediting his ministry.
