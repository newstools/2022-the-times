The owner of a tavern  a few metres away from Mdlalose’s, where 15 people were killed this weekend, says he is not taking chances and has hired more security. Yanga Mdelwa is also no longer allowing patrons to drink at the premises, insisting they only order “takeaway” alcohol. Mdelwa spoke to TimesLIVE  after a  mass shooting  a short distance from his  tavern at the weekend. “What is happening in our community is making us uncomfortable. We are scared because these people come and kill without taking anything. We are  not sure why this is happening. We  have bouncers here, but we can’t say we are safe because they don’t carry guns,” he said. “We feel unsafe, especially because of how everything happened. They  came in and fired shots. We are not safe. I am traumatised.” On Monday police minister Bheki Cele visited the area   with Joburg mayor Mpho Phalatse and  national police commissioner  Lt-Gen  Fannie Masemola. The group was met by an angry crowd  demanding answers  about  a lack of visible policing and alleged incompetence at the Orlando police station. In a separate incident, four people were killed in a tavern shooting in Pietermaritzburg at the weekend. Police arrested two suspects  on Monday. The shootings come two weeks after  21 teenagers died mysteriously in a tavern in  Scenery Park, East London. While the three incidents are unrelated, the mass fatalities have raised concern about  levels of security at township drinking establishments.
