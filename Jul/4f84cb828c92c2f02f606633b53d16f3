The ANC in Tolomane Mnyayiza region (formerly Lower South Coast) has whisked away one of the wards  previously held by the DA in a by-election this week. The party claimed  victory in the by-election in Ward 13 in Umdoni local municipality, with councillor Ravinand Samlall Maharaj taking the spoils. The win came  after the party held its provincial elective conference  at the weekend  where new party leaders were elected. The ANC collected 470 votes, the EFF  378 while the DA  received 273. Al-Jama-Ah received 243 votes, the IFP 147 and the AMC  70 votes while the PFP   got 14 votes. The DFA  won a single vote. Bheki Mtolo, the newly elected KZN ANC provincial secretary said the ANC undertakes to strengthen service delivery to demonstrate its appreciation to ordinary members of society who once again voted for it. “ANC councillors in Tolomane Mnyayiza region, as guided by the robust engagements from the ninth ANC elective conference held this past weekend, will put on top of the agenda efforts aimed at driving local economic development to create jobs for local communities.  All cadres of the movement understand that freedom without access to economic opportunities is not complete,” he said. However, Mtolo encouraged councillors  to work with all political parties. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
