Singer and reality TV star Kelly Khumalo is convinced Jub Jub does not want to be part of their son’s life. In the long-awaited first episode of the Showmax Original reality series Life With Kelly Khumalo season 3 on Tuesday, the singer was having drinks with her friend, musician Wanda Baloyi. Referring to the Mother's Day message Jub Jub shared on his socials for her, Kelly told Wanda  she  saw the  message that was trending on social media but didn't get a direct message from Jub Jub. “I know a man who wants a relationship with his child when I see one, I will never stand in the way of doing that. Don't disrespect me,” she said in her video diaries on the show. Kelly  a woman  private messaged her about her ex and baby daddy, asking her to give him a chance. “This is what annoys me. Some slay queen with a big bum DMs me to say: 'Molemo is my friend. All he talks about is his son and I hope you find it in your heart to allow him to prove himself'.” Kelly also  said  anyone who tried to use any dark magic against her would  see the results backfire on them because she was “untouchable”. “I’m child of the gods. If you try to do away with me, it comes back to you. “Spiritually, you can’t touch me. It is that clear. If you are pointing a weapon at me, it will come back to you, whether you like it or not.” Her statements  left some  fans confused about what she was alluding to. In a bid to explain what she meant, the singer and songwriter shared a clip on her Instagram timeline recently in which she said some dlozis are stronger than others. Watch video below :
