A man was shot dead at a tavern in Mamelodi, Tshwane, in the early hours of Monday. Police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Sello said three suspects wearing balaclavas and armed with pistols arrived at the Monaco tavern and found  a group of people sitting around. “The trio fired in the air before approaching the 33-year-old man and shooting him twice,” Sello said. She said the motive was unknown and  police were investigating a case of murder. The incident follows three other shootings at taverns in Soweto, Katlehong and Pietermaritzburg at the weekend  in which 22 people were killed. A week earlier, 21 underage children  died  in a tavern in the Eastern Cape. The children were found slumped  in  chairs and on tables while others had dropped on  the dance floor. Their deaths  are still being investigated. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
