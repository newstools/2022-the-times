Obento Ramen Bar in Parkmore is the delicious brainchild of Daniel Liu and Ling Chiu who were inspired to get into the catering business during the first big lockdown in 2020 and was born out of demystifying and bringing together Western hospitality and Eastern food cultures. While some South Africans were busy buying pineapples to brew beer or studying the intricacies of sourdough starters,  Chiu — a former architect and construction project manager — and former facility manager  Liu, were busy at home cooking up traditional ramen bowls, dim sum and other dishes enjoyed during extensive travels through Korea, China and Japan. Says Liu: “Ramen is our go-to comfort food, a simple bowl of humble flavours which excite the mind and palate in each bite. During lockdown, with our inability to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions around the world, we found ourselves missing a good bowl of ramen from our favourite spots around Asia. We had dined at some restaurants in  Joburg and Cape Town which offer ramen, but most could never achieve the deep richness of the broth and the chewiness of the noodles we loved and experienced in other parts of the world. “So our focus was dedicated to developing and then bringing the true ramen experience, made predominately with pork, to Johannesburg, with our focus on true Japanese-style deep pork bone broth and handmade fresh noodles.”              Liu’s mother (a restaurateur and chef, as is most of his family) lent a hand and within a few weeks they had launched an online frozen meal service and a stall at  Fourways Farmers Market. By the time winter 2021 had rolled around, it was time to keep following their fans' requests for more and finally open a permanent dining space which celebrates its first anniversary next month . When the small eatery opened last year it focused predominantly on ramen though the menu has expanded to include starters such as spicy fried Korean chicken, BBQ pork bao buns and adding mains like katsu curry, Buddha bowls and rice pots. There are also monthly specials. Says Liu, who is in the kitchen while Chiu runs  front-of-house: “A good ramen must have the right composition of fat, salt and sweetness behind every bite, thus the true element one tries to achieve to have a good ramen experience, is time. With adequate time, bone broth can ultimately break down to its pure essence and give off a real umami sensation. Noodles are an intricate part of a good ramen, and freshly made noodles will always be superior over store bought, factory made dried noodles. “Our flavours at Obento are uniquely South African and we didn't necessarily adapt the flavour profiles for the South African market, but rather the fresh produce we use is from SA and is distinctly different from flavours from Japan, but the methodology of preparation is of a very Japanese style of making ramen.” “Traditional favourites are where Obento excels,” adds Chiu. Two of the most popular ramen offerings are the melt-in-the-mouth Taiwan beef in a hearty beef broth and the Tonkotsu with its rich and buttery pork bone broth and slices of succulent Chashu pork belly. The latter also comes with a spicy chilli option. It’s hard to decide what is best in this bowl of comfort food — the broth, the noodles or the luscious ramen egg with its soft centre. There are two vegetarian/vegan options: one in a soy sauce broth and the other in a miso broth. Having eaten there many times with great relish, my only lament is the wine prices, very steep, and they don’t allow BYO. Stick to beer, way more affordable and a good accompaniment to steaming bowls of ramen. If you don't feel like eating out or there s no table is available, Obento offers frozen meals to enjoy at home. In the small deli and freezer section you can find a selection of handmade dim sum ready to steam at home as well as the Taiwanese beef noodles and Tonkotsu Chashu noodles, or order online at obento.co.za for  delivery. Obento Ramen Bar is located at Shop 18 Parkmore Square on 11th Street, Parkmore, Sandton. For reservations, call 064-704-6265.
