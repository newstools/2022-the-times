Daily reporting of Covid-19 data by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), which has been in place since March 2020, will  end on Friday. For  more than two years, the institute gave daily updates on the number of new infections, Covid-19 related hospitalisations and deaths, a provincial breakdown of the figures and the number of people  tested  for the virus. The NICD said  this phase of the pandemic, coupled with dwindling Covid-19  numbers, has necessitated a re-evaluation of the daily reporting strategy. “The reporting of Covid-19 surveillance data, however, including the latest testing summary, will continue as  normal, with the data  published in the existing weekly surveillance reports. These reports are available from Wednesdays.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
