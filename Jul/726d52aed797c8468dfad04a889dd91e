A nine-year-old child was hit by a vehicle from the Tour de France's publicity caravan and was taken to hospital, organisers told Reuters on Friday. The child, who suffered a bruise on his head and a suspected leg injury, was conscious when he was taken to the Couple Enfant hospital in La Tronche, near Grenoble, a spokesperson for Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) said. “The vehicle was going at a low speed. He was taken care of by the publicity caravan medical staff before the first responders took him to the hospital,” they said. The 13th stage was a 193km ride from Le Bourg d'Oisans to Saint Etienne.
