The SACP is on Wednesday giving an update on its 15th national congress. It's anticipated the party  will be weighing its options  after the realisation that its partner in government, the ANC, may drop below 50%  in the 2024 national and provincial polls. The SACP and Cosatu have been married to the  governing party since it assumed  power after the 1994 democratic breakthrough.
