The suspect arrested in connection  with the Katlehong tavern shooting will not  appear in court on Monday as  the matter is yet to be enrolled, says the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw said this was due to “insufficient evidence”. The police  said earlier the suspect  arrested in connection with the shooting at the Mputlane Inn tavern  was an Ekurhuleni metro police officer. The officer was alleged to have been among four men who stormed the tavern on July 8, opening fire at patrons. Six people were shot. Two died on the scene. The officer had been expected to appear at the Palm Ridge magistrate’s court  after his arrest on Friday. Police spokesperson Col Sello Dimakatso said investigations were  continuing.
