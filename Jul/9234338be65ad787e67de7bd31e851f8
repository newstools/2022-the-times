Three people have been arrested by the Western Cape anti-gang unit on illegal firearm charges. A 19-year-old man was arrested on a charge of possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition, while a 23-year-old man and 49-year-old woman were arrested on charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Members of the unit were conducting an intelligence-driven operation in Manenberg when they recovered the firearms in separate incidents, said SAPS spokesperson Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi. A 9mm pistol, two rifles and ammunition were seized. The suspects are expected to appear soon in the Athlone magistrate's court.
