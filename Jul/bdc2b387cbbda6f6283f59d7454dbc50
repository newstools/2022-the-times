Two suspects held in connection with the shooting at a tavern in Sweetwaters, Pietermaritzburg, on Saturday night, in which four people died, have been released. Two men are alleged to have entered  Sakhi's tavern and  opened fire on  patrons, hitting at least 12 people. Two  died at the scene and two died later. A police source close to the investigation, who spoke to TimesLIVE on Wednesday, said charges were withdrawn as there was not enough evidence to warrant them being kept in custody. “There are many leads  we are following and I can assure you there will be arrests made.” Lt-Col Nqobile Gwala confirmed their release, saying the men had first been  held for questioning and later released. It is understood the pair, who were taken in on Monday, were spotted leaving the tavern shortly after the shootings. KwaZulu-Natal  police commissioner Lt-Gen Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi confirmed on Tuesday that police had made  arrests. He said police were able to locate the vehicle used in the crime and  more arrests  were imminent. Meanwhile, the  KwaZulu-Natal Liquor Authority said it  would soon make public the findings of an investigation to determine  whether there were  breaches of the liquor licence conditions. Acting  CEO Bheki Mbanjwa  visited the tavern after the shooting on Sunday  accompanied by the compliance and enforcement team. He said one of the licence requirements  was to ensure security  for patrons. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
