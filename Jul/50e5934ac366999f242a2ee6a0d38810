Health minister  Joe Phaahla on Tuesday tested positive for Covid-19 after experiencing minor symptoms. “Minister Phaahla took tests earlier today [Tuesday] and the results came back positive and he immediately self-isolated,” health department spokesperson Foster Mohale said. “He will perform his official duties from home for  seven days and all his planned contact meetings have been rescheduled while others [were] converted into virtual.” The department said this was a reminder that the pandemic  remained and was infectious. This was the reason  it continued to report daily Covid-19  positive cases and deaths. “Minister Phaahla has received two doses of J&J Covid-19 vaccine which he believes  has boosted his immunity against the severity of the virus. “The department would like to remind the public that lifting the Covid-19 restrictions doesn't mean the pandemic is over, hence vaccination  services remain accessible at all times at selected sites,” Mohale said.
