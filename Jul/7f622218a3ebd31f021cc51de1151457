People  in the Cape can start lighting their fireplaces and arranging extra blankets, with a cold front already moving over SA — and in parts of the Eastern Cape and Lesotho snow is expected to start falling by Saturday  afternoon. Senior SA Weather Service forecaster Jan Vermeulen said people, especially in the Eastern Cape, can expect  a cold weekend. “The cold front is already moving through the country. By tomorrow it will reach Ermelo in Mpumalanga. There will be rain but it should start clearing by Monday,”  he said. “The front should reach Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the Free State at about the same time. “Snow is expected to start falling by this afternoon — mostly in the Barkly East area and Lesotho, but the furthest north where we may see snow is Mont-aux-Sources in the Drakensberg range.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
