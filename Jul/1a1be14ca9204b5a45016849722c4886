Eskom says stage 4 load-shedding is in effect until 4pm on Friday, instead of the heightened stage 6 that had been announced. “Overnight we have replenished our emergency reserves sufficiently to not require stage 6 load-shedding during the morning. However, stage 6 load-shedding will be implemented from  4pm to 10pm  to not further deplete the reserves. Stage 4 is being implemented until 4pm,” the electricity utility said.
