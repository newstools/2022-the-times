Banyana Banyana are the pride of the nation after their heroic performance beating Morocco in front of their vociferous home support in the Women's Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) final in Rabat on Saturday night. A brace from Hildah Makgaia (63rd and 71st minutes) secured a storming win in the final and a first Wafcon title for previously five-time runners-up Banyana. Rosella Ayane pulled one back for Morocco in the 80th to make for a dramatic, nail-biting last 10 minutes in front of the packed Stade Prince Moulay Abdellah in Rabat, where Morocco were supported by the deafening noise generated by their home support. Banyana were the first team to win all six matches at a Wafcon. They beat 11-time champions Nigeria 2-1 in their opening Group C match, then Burundi 3-1 and finished the group with their win against Botswana. They beat Tunisia 1-0 in the quarterfinals and Zambia 1-0 in the semifinals, conceding just three goals in the tournament. SA return to OR Tambo International Airport on Tuesday.
