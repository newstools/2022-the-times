Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is on Thursday outlining the plan for the 2023 academic year online application process for grade 1 and 8 pupils. The online application process is often faced with technical challenges that see  a number of parents and guardians unable to apply as a result of glitches. The first phase is for grade 7 pupils now  in public primary schools applying for grade 8 and the second phase for grade 1 as well as grade 8 pupils not in grade 7 in public schools.
