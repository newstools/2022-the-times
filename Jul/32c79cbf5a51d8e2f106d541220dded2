ANC policy head Jeff Radebe says members implicated in the state capture commission's report will be given two months to account  to the party's integrity commission. The report found most of the corruption in government under former president Jacob Zuma's administration happened “under the nose” of the ANC. A task team within the party was formed to deal with the findings in the report. The ANC briefed the media on Wednesday before its sixth policy conference this weekend. Radebe said more than 200 ANC members have been implicated. “When we have all the names and have indicated that to the SG's office and the integrity committee,  the two months will start,”  said Radebe.
