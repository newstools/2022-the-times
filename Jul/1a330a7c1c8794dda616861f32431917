President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation at 8pm on Monday  on measures to  deal with the  energy crisis. “The briefing by the president follows a number of consultations within government and with stakeholders and energy experts outside  government to find a collective solution to the energy crisis,” the presidency said. “The president has held consultative meetings with business, civil society, labour and leaders of political parties represented in parliament.” Late last month, Eskom implemented stage 6 load-shedding  and attributed it to an unprotected strike by  employees at  power stations. Writing in his newsletter two weeks ago, Ramaphosa admitted load-shedding had  disrupted the economy and caused  hardship. After working with relevant ministers and senior officials on additional measures to  speed up efforts to increase electricity supply, government would soon complete  the necessary work and consultations for this. The presidency said Ramaphosa visited Tutuka power station in Mpumalanga and Eskom's Megawatt Park headquarters in Johannesburg on July 16 and  met power station managers “to gain an understanding” of the challenges affecting Eskom's generation fleet.
