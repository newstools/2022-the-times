While the nation mourns the deaths of 21 people in three separate shooting incidents at   taverns  at the weekend, the silence in SA’s political arena around gun control  is coming to the fore. Join the discussion: A report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime released late last year  found  SA has an estimated 2.35-million illegal firearms  in circulation. Most of the weapons  become instruments of violent crime and  come directly from state departments and domestic homes. Meanwhile,   crimes during the 2021/22 period increased significantly, according to  police service crime stats, both as a result of reported crimes and a jump in the number of crimes detected through police activity. In today’s episode of Sunday Times Politics Weekly, our host Mike Siluma holds a gun control conversation. Should South  Africans arm themselves  for protection from the escalating threat of violent crime, or will more firearms in our society simply proliferate the issues? Also, why are  political parties so quiet  about gun control? Siluma is joined in studio by Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime researcher Jenni Irish-Qhobosheane, Gun Free SA representative and former  police commander Jeremy Vearey and firearms legal expert Martin Hood.
