Trevor took over from  The Daily Show host Jon Stewart in 2015. When he started, the  SA-born comedian said there were high expectations  and he was told not to fail. “I remember South Africans saying to me: 'Hey, man, if you fail, we all look bad. They’re never going to give any African any type of big TV show again. So don’t mess this up'.” Trevor recently hosted the 64th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony where internationally-acclaimed DJ Black Coffee made history by bagging the award for the best dance/electronic music album for his album Subconsciously.
