A helicopter landed on the N1 north at Garsfontein on  its way to Pretoria on Saturday  night after a multi-vehicle accident that left at least 50  people injured. Mike Gough from ProMed  was on the scene and said the accident   happened  while an ambulance was attending to another  accident just before 8pm. According to Gough, there  was one critical patient from a taxi who  was  airlifted to hospital. He said 18 patients were transported to hospital, including a baby. He said the ambulance was attending to an accident when the second crash, involving 13 vehicles, a 52-seater bus, a taxi, a truck and an ambulance, occurred. Though all the passengers on the bus were injured, none needed transportation to hospital. The exact cause of the accident is still unclear. Paramedics warned that the northbound lanes  were closed.
