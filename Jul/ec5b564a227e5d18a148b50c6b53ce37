Panyaza Lesufi has stepped as president of Swallows FC after his election as Gauteng provincial chair for the ANC. The Gauteng education MEC was part of a consortium that bought the First Division (NFD) franchise of Maccabi FC in 2019, helping resurrect the Birds after they plunged as far as the third-tier ABC Motsepe League after their relegation fro the DStv Premiership in 2014-15. Lesufi tweeted on Sunday: “With my new responsibilities, today, painfully so, I had to resign my position as president of Swallows. I wish the team well. Don’t follow me follow the birds.” Swallows won the 2019-20 NFD title to be promoted back to the top-flight, where they ended the 2020-21 season in sixth position. In the past campaign Swallows battled and survived relegation via the playoffs.
