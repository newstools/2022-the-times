Light-hearted fun or further proof  she continues to need the conservatorship? That is the question many have been asking  after US pop star Britney Spears  raised eyebrows with her recent Instagram posts. The singer has left fans shocked, in awe and  confused  about the nude snaps she shared in the past week. It  started with a saucy snap she shared last week  in which she is seen holding her dog with nothing on.  A smiling Spears manages to tastefully cover  sensitive body parts using her pet pooch and a diamond emoji. While some fans found the picture odd and “creepy”, many praised her for the boldness and for radiating happiness. Things  took a bizarre turn when the  Toxic hit maker took to the social media platform on Monday to again post  images of her naked while covering her private parts with her hands and a heart emoji. Spears  said the images are “photo dumps” from before her latest pregnancy, which she announced last month. The latest  snaps have been met with  concern for her wellbeing, with some feeling  this proved  she  continues to need her  terminated conservatorship. In November last year, a judge ended her 13-year conservatorship that had allowed her father, Jamie Spears, to control her personal life and multimillion  dollar estate. The guardianship was put in place after the starlet had a mental health breakdown  in 2007. Staunch fans maintain that the mother of two is revelling in her newfound freedom and should be allowed to enjoy herself and post what makes her happy.
