Fellow cast member and veteran actress Connie Chiume, who plays Sonto on Gomora, confirmed the news to TshisaLIVE saying the production had just sent them messages announcing Zubane's tragic death. Chiume said she was devastated by Siyabonga's sudden passing. “We are so devastated on why do we keep losing our young kids, our future leaders, talented people like this. What's going on, especially in our industry? We don't know what to say, what to do, something needs to be done.” There is no confirmed cause of death at the moment though it is believed the young actor took his own life.
