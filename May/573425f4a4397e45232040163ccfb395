Springbok scrumhalf Faf de Klerk  was a happy man after popping the question to his long-time girlfriend Miné van Niekerk  this week. “Engaged! Blessed with the best. Love you, my skat,” he wrote on Instagram. His bae, who often gushes over Faf, also confirmed the good news by sharing a snap via her Instagram account.

Some fans admitted to finding him attractive, but TimesLIVE reported he was taken. Here are other snaps of the couple:
