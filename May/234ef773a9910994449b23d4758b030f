One thing meat-loving South Africans  adore is grilled prawns. The tasty crustaceans  look more like a Parktown prawn with their heads, eyes and feelers and “feet”, raw,  grey and unpalatable, but add heat and miraculously the shell turns  into a beautiful orangey pink, proffering an evocative aroma of the sea while cooking and the flesh turns into a tender sweet mouthful. Drizzled generously with olive oil, butter and garlic, add a pile of rice, lemon and garlic butter sauce — and for chilli lovers an essential, the Mozambican influence, a dollop of piri piri sauce - enjoyed  with a glass of chilled zesty sauvignon blanc and you have a finger-licking feast. The best part is sucking out the last of the sweet flesh from the shell. Made you hungry for these juicy crustaceans? Here are a variety of restaurants offering great specials on grilled prawns. Look forward to an “all you can eat” prawn fest  at GrandWest in the Quarterdeck Restaurant which starts on Thursday, , and then every first Thursday of the month. Indulge in delicious prawns for R350 per person, R200 for children under 12 and R150 for children under six. Bookings are essential.
