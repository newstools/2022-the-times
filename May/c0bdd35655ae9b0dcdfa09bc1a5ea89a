Former Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama and Trillian’s Eric Wood  were granted bail of R50,000 and R250,000 respectively by the specialised commercial crimes court in Palm Ridge on Friday. Their co-accused, Transnet’s former finance head Garry Pita and Trillian co-founder Daniel Roy, were also released on bail of R50,000, while ex-Transnet treasurer Phetolo Ramosebudi was bailed for R25,000 by magistrate Brian Nemavhidi. The National Prosecuting Authority’s Investigating Directorate (ID) disclosed the five arrests early on Friday, saying the accused face charges related to allegedly contravening the Public Finance Management Act, fraud, corruption and money laundering. ID spokesperson Sindisiwe Seboka said they joined alleged Gupta family fixer Kuben Moodley, who was arrested last September in connection with the matter. TimesLIVE reported at the time that Moodley’s arrest on charges of fraud, theft, corruption and money laundering was linked to contracts allegedly improperly awarded by Transnet to Regiments Capital and Trillian, as well as alleged theft by Regiments Fund managers from the Transnet Second Defined Benefit Fund. Gama is among the former Transnet executives, including Pita, who state capture inquiry chairperson chief justice Raymond Zondo said should be investigated over transactions between the state-owned enterprise and the Guptas and their associates.
