A 72-hour mobilisation plan has been activated to trace, track and arrest four  murder suspects who opened fire on a group of people in Bethelsdorp, Gqeberha, after midnight on Wednesday, killing four   and  wounding five others. According to  police, the nine victims were sitting in a garage with other people when two cars  stopped at the gate of the house. Four unidentified  men with their faces covered  entered through the gate. They are alleged to have separated the group of people before opening fire on the nine victims. Four people — their ages unknown — died at the scene. Five others, aged between 29 and 31, were wounded and taken to a nearby hospital. The circumstances surrounding the  shooting are  under investigation. Four cases of murder and five of attempted murder have been registered. No arrests have been made. The SA Police Service  appealed to anyone who may have information that could  lead to the arrest of the suspects to   contact  their nearest police station or call Crime Stop on 08600-10-111.
