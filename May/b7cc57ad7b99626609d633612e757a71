Brighton & Hove Albion trounced Manchester United 4-0 in the Premier League on Saturday, as Ralf Rangnick's side suffered a fifth straight away defeat with another woeful defensive display. Moises Caicedo netted his first goal in a Brighton shirt in the 15th minute when he took advantage of the ball ricocheting off Alex Telles to tuck a low drive inside the post from outside of the box. Marc Cucurella made it 2-0 after the break, firing into the roof of the net from close range. Pascal Gross then steered a shot past David de Gea before Leandro Trossard added the fourth when Diogo Dalot’s clearance bounced off his chest and into the United goal. The hosts continued to pick holes in the United defence and piled on the pressure, but could not add to their tally. United attempted to fight back but a strong goalkeeping performance from Robert Sanchez kept them out. United have now conceded 56 goals in the Premier League this season, their worst defensive record in a single campaign in the competition. The result means it is now mathematically impossible for sixth-placed United to qualify for the Champions League, as they sit five points adrift of fourth-placed Arsenal with one game left to play. Brighton are ninth, five points off a Europa Conference League spot with two remaining matches.
