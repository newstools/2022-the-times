The EFF’s growth in the North West continues  after the party wrested a ward from the ANC in the May 4 by-elections. This as the electoral fortunes of the ANC continue on a downward spiral  after their bloodied nose  in the November 2021 local polls, where the party dipped below 50% for the first time in its history of contesting elections. The red berets thumped the ANC in Mahikeng ward 5,   scooping more than two-thirds of the votes cast with a 42.04% voter turnout. The defeat for the ANC was  huge after the party  won the  ward by more than 50% just six months ago during the 2021 local government polls. Of the four  by-elections  on Wednesday, the ANC  retained  two wards, in Ntabankulu and Nelson Mandela Bay municipalities  and lost the one to the EFF in Mahikeng, while the DA retained a ward in Tshwane. Where the ANC and DA retained their wards in NMB and Tshwane, voter turnout was poor at just more than  20%. Overall in all four wards, the ANC received  37% of the votes, followed  by the DA at 20% with the EFF coming in third at 19%. ActionSA garnered 10% of the votes.
