“Crime is what we were born for as k****rs.” These were the words  Free State mayor Motloheloa Mokatsane said to a crowd of black community members  demonstrating outside the Viljoenskroon  magistrate’s court. The crowd was there in connection  with a gender-based violence case. A video of Mokatsane  saying this in Sesotho has been doing the rounds on social media. He seemed to be taken aback when community members  objected to him referring to  them as k****rs. Some  said “no” and shook their heads in disagreement with his statement. “OK comrades, let me put in a different way,” he said as he tried to salvage the situation. “We, as black people,  are violent and suffering violence every day,” he said. Mokatsane’s office has since issued a statement,  saying he  apologised unreservedly to the community and the nation for his “reckless” use of the k-word. “The mayor wholeheartedly retracts the use of the k-word and the offence this might have caused to the entire society,” the statement read.
