Days before the start of the ANC Eastern Cape’s ninth provincial conference, it has emerged  there are  pending issues that could lead to the conference  not sitting if unresolved. According to a letter sent  by provincial task team (PTT) coordinator Lulama Ngcukayitobi, an urgent meeting will include national executive committee  officials and  PTT officials to discuss  pending matters.
