A mother who was able to rebuke and guide him about his character as a gospel artist. He said the gospel star was battling to walk and her feet were the only thing that were ailing her. “She could walk but not for long because she stayed in hospital for two months in January and February so the body was still not well because she is an elder. She would walk for a while and then get tired that's why she was performing in a wheelchair because she couldn't stand for that long, because her body was not well at all. “Mme Deborah loved jokes, wherever she was she was always happy ...  she was a very good and a very straightforward person. If she didn't like it she would say it straight away,” he said Social media has been flooded with fond memories of the star's music and the impact it has had on their lives. Deborah's death came hours after Gomora actor Siyabonga Zubane was laid to rest.
