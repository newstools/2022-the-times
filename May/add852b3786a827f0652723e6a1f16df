The Johannesburg metropolitan police department (JMPD) has urged communities not to take part in illegal land invasions and the purchasing of illegal land. JMPD officials conducted an operation to crack down on illegal land invasion  at Zandspruit informal settlement on Tuesday in collaboration with police. JMPD spokesperson Xolani Fihla said they demolished three brick and mortar structures built on   a pavement which were unoccupied. “The three structures were built in an area where they are not supposed to be. The people who bought them were occupying the land illegally. Two of the structures were on the pavement and that is not allowed due to  bylaws and the National Road Traffic Act,” he said. He said  many land invasion operations had been conducted in Johannesburg this year  and more were planned. “We urge people not to partake in this illegal activity and we  urge members of the public who  come across any illegal land invasion or have  information regarding land invasion to contact the City of Johannesburg.” Fihla urged the public to be cautious. “There  are laws governing the building of structures in the city and within the province. You cannot build a structure on land  you don’t legally own. You find  the land is privately owned  or is owned by the city or  province. Before you can  build on that land, you need to have  authorisation from  the private landowner, the city or the province.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
