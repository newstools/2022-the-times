A video of suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule with Duduzane Zuma has  tongues wagging online. The KwaZulu-Natal ANC ward 11 branch chairperson met  Magashule  at the weekend to chat about legacy and the future of young people in political leadership. “As much as people think they have us in the corner, remember one thing: we all have an ace up our sleeves,” said Duduzane. Said Magashule: “They want to be leaders by force. If you watch every corner, people want to be leaders by hook or by crook. But we are there, we are watching the space and we are  saying to our people to remain strong where they are. This too shall pass, the revolution and the struggle will a luta continua.” The posts drew mixed reactions online, with some approving of the meeting and others questioning what else was discussed between the two. Zuma has said he wants to follow in his father, former president Jacob Zuma's, footsteps and has been seen campaigning for support. In December last year, he said his pursuit was more than a dream, and not even his lack of experience in politics would deter him. He  has a plan he believes will turn the ANC and SA around. “If you’re saying I’m competing against someone it means we walk on the same path. I’m walking a completely different path,” he told Newsbreak Lotus. “We’re going to do things differently and there’s no-one in that lane. That’s a lane I’m creating because I believe that’s the only way we’re going to overturn and overhaul the situation through the ANC.” Speaking on Power 98.7, Zuma said: “It is less of a dream but more of conversations. I think over a period of time we all have these conversations about how we get involved in making a difference. “I have been a businessman my whole life, an entrepreneur, and politics is very new to me. I’ve followed it, I have understood it and was a part of it,” he said. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
