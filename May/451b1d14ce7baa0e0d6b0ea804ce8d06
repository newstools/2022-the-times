Convicted killer cop Nomia Rosemary Ndlovu and her co-accused Nomsa Mudau appeared in the Kempton Park magistrate’s court on Wednesday morning. The pair  are accused of plotting  to murder  Nomsa’s ex-husband Justice Mudau for an insurance payout. Justice attended the court appearance of his ex-wife, who he says “stole his happiness” and ripped apart his family. “Considering there was another charge, where she threatened to finish me off,  I have to go for a protection order.” The case was postponed to May 31.
