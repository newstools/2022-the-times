Three years after two councillors were murdered  before reporting on maladministration in the Mogalakwena municipality in Limpopo, their alleged killers have  been  arrested. Four suspects appeared in court on Wednesday for the 2019 murders. Samuel Seruputlane, 50, Jabulane Petros Mashamaite, 43, James Mswezi Chuma, 42, and Nkholo Frans Mangadi, 49, appeared in the Mokopane magistrate's court  on charges of conspiracy to commit murder, two counts of murder and unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. They  were arrested on Tuesday. Their alleged victims are Vaaltyn Kekana, 54, and Ralph Kanyane, 32. According to a report by NPA spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, at the time Kekana was killed he was about to table a report  in the  council  on alleged irregular expenditure or maladministration. On July 23 2019, the two councillors were sitting in a car in Mokopane  when  gunmen approached and  shot them. Both men died at the scene. “The assailants  fled on foot and boarded a getaway  vehicle  waiting for them  in a nearby street.” Mashamaite has another  case pending in which  he and 28 others, including  companies,  face 121 counts of corruption,  money laundering and conspiracy to commit corruption. That matter was postponed to July 19 for pre-trial conference in the Polokwane specialised commercial crimes court. The four accused in the murder trial will   appear again on May 17 for a bail  application. They  remain in custody until then.
