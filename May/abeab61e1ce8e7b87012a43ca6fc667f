There’s no denying that the workplace is different to what it was before the Covid-19 pandemic gripped the globe. But after two years of the “new normal”, where staff may be working from the office, remotely or a combination of the two, some organisations are still struggling with how they can get the most productivity out of their teams. Companies around the world are facing mass resignations and a reduced tolerance from employees to return to the “traditional” way of doing things post-pandemic. How can technology be used to bridge the gap between what was and what is? In this podcast, Jeff Ryan, MD of AWCape, a leading Sage  business partner for HR, payroll and financial solutions, and Gerhard Hartman,  vice-president of medium business at Sage Africa & Middle East, share their views on driving high performance teams in a tech-enabled environment where top talent expects more flexibility in the workplace.
