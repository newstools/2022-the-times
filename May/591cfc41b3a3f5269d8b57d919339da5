Bafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos has included Orlando Pirates forward Thembinkosi Lorch in his preliminary squad for next month’s kickoff of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Morocco and Zimbabwe. Broos has continued to cast his net wide and seek young talent, pressing ahead with his rebuilding emphasis as he included SuperSport United defender Luke Fleurs, 22, and strikers Ashley du Preez (24, Stellenbosch FC) and Khanyisa Mayo (23, Cape Town City) in his 27-man squad. Lorch, 28, is included having missed out on a number of previous call-ups during Broos’s tenure due to injuries. The SA Football Association said Bafana “begin the qualifying programme with matches against Morocco at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium [in Rabat] on June 9 and Zimbabwe at FNB Stadium four days later, on June 13”. Pirates’ 32-year-old midfielder Thabang Monare retains his place. Broos has controversially made an exception to his youth policy by including Monare, but excluded Mamelodi Sundowns’ in-form Andile Jali and Themba Zwane. The squad, though, has a youthful, energetic and exciting look to it, and could produce good results against Morocco and Zimbabwe.
