Health minister Joe Phaahla said on Tuesday almost 70% of the population has come into contact with Covid-19. The minister made the revelation while he tabled the department’s budget vote before a mini-plenary of the National Assembly. Its focus was on health priorities including Covid-19 management, National Health Insurance  and the response to communicable and non-communicable diseases. The minister said while 70% had developed natural immunity against Covid-19, he stressed  vaccination  remained the most effective response against the coronavirus. Phaahla said government had made strides in its vaccination drive with  more than 35-million South Africans vaccinated, but millions  need to get their jabs. “While  more than 70% of the population have had contact with the virus, and therefore we have some natural immunity, the truth is this immunity wears with time and  cannot be boosted. While the virus is among us, the best defence is vaccination.” The minister defended government’s response to the pandemic, with his  comments directed at “armchair critics” who are against the implementation of protective measures., saying they are for the benefit and safety of South Africans. He said government finds “no joy” in inconveniencing South Africans with the regulations. “We completely disagree with armchair critics who argue  we should drop all public health measures and  let the virus spread at will and only worry about whether hospitals are full,” he said.
