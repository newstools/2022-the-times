Former finance minister Trevor Manuel is not backing down in his battle with TV host and political commentator JJ Tabane. The two have been at  loggerheads for weeks over claims made by Tabane in a podcast hosted by Sbusiso “DJ Sbu” Leope. Tabane claimed  Manuel was involved in the formation of ANC splinter party Cope  while he was  a national executive committee member of the governing party. Manuel has  applied to the Johannesburg high court, seeking an order  to force Tabane and DJ Sbu to  retract the claims unconditionally. The Old Mutual board chairperson also wants the duo to jointly  pay him R100,000 in damages for defamation. Manuel wants his application heard on an urgent basis after Tabane refused to  apologise and withdraw his claims. The court, submitted Manuel, must order that his demands be met within 24 hours of the ruling in the event it favours him. The order, according to Manuel’s notice of motion, must demand the following from Tabane and DJ Sbu: Tabane has filed a notice notifying the court that he will oppose Manuel’s application.
