According to Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst, medics who assessed the scene on Sunday found “absolute devastation”, with both the dead and injured strewn around the scene. The incident occurred at 06:16. Ten people were killed, 11 sustained critical injuries and 54  minor to moderate injuries. “Due to the serious nature of two of the patients' injuries, a Netcare 911 helicopter as well as another private EMS helicopter were activated to airlift the most seriously injured. “The remaining injured were treated on scene and once stabilised were transported by various ambulance services to hospital.” In another accident, at 04:45 on Saturday, two people sustained critical injuries after a truck and bakkie collided on the N1 Samrand in Centurion, Gauteng. According to Herbst, the truck driver was not injured, but two occupants of the bakkie sustained critical injuries and were “mechanically entrapped” in the wreckage. “The patients were treated on scene while a Netcare 911 rescue technician used hydraulic tools to free them from the vehicle. “Once stabilised, both patients were transported to hospital for further care.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
