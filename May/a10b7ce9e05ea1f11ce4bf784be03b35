Celebrated poet and writer Mazisi Kunene was born on May 12 1930 in Durban. He is the latest in a string of SA icons to be honoured by Google with a doodle. Here are five things you should know about Kunene and what made him a global arts giant. Kunene became famous around the world for his writings on the history of the Zulu nation, with global audiences captivated by his works, including: Emperor Shaka the Great, Zulu Poems, The Ancestors & the Sacred Mountain, and Anthem of the Decades. Kunene went into exile during apartheid and became a leading figure in the fight for freedom and democracy. He was an ANC representative in Europe and a cultural adviser to Unesco. Kunene was the first poet laureate of the democratic SA and won  the Bantu Literary Competition Award in 1956. Besides teaching at institutions in SA and Lesotho, Kunene studied in England and taught at the University of California, University of Iowa and was a visiting professor of African literature at Stanford University, among others. Kunene returned to SA in 1992. He died in 2006 after a long battle with cancer.
