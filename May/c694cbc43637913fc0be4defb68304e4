Former Johannesburg mayor Mpho Moerane is expected to be discharged soon after responding positively to his treatment  after a car accident, his family says. Moerane was said to be in critical condition after being involved in a “horrible” car crash on Monday night. His family said the ANC caucus leader in the Johannesburg municipality was well on his way to a full recovery  after what they described as a serious accident. TimesLIVE has seen images of Moerane's mangled Mercedes-Benz. The entire front  of the vehicle was destroyed as the front tyres of the car appeared to have burst, leaving  the car resting  on its rims. The airbags  were all deployed while the sunroof  and the windows  were smashed. “Moerane is in good spirits, responding well to treatment, his condition has been stabilised and he is steadily moving towards full recovery. Doctors are still monitoring him and he will be discharged in no time,” family spokesperson Mike Maile said  on Wednesday evening. The family appealed  to South Africans and Johannesburg residents to “keep on praying” for his speedy recovery as he gets stronger each day. “We also strongly urge members of the media to avoid speculating about his condition and afford the Moerane family and medical professionals space as they continue to nurse him towards full recovery,” Maile said. Maile  said there was “no crisis” and that Moerane would soon be assuming his duties in the  Johannesburg municipality and in the ANC in the region. Moerane was expected to contest for the top position of chair in the Johannesburg regional conference initially scheduled for this weekend but since  postponed. It is now expected to take place at end of May.
