A defence lawyer in the Senzo Meyiwa trial wants the  high court in Pretoria to exclude the Ten10 Films production company, which aired a documentary on the murder on Netflix, from further proceedings. Advocate  Malesela Teffo told the court  the production company had spoken to witnesses which  opened them up  to intimidation and harassment. “My witnesses have been exposed to all kind of threats. This is not only  affecting our clients but the family of the bereaved.” Teffo  said with the media they  had a platform where they could lay a formal complaint (the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of SA), but the production company represented an entity which  was not a “media house”  and was in court as a business concern to gather material that  would be used for commercial gain. He accused the  company of “coming through the back door”, saying  it  took advantage of the media applications. “They say they want to inform the public ... which public? Unless you have money to afford Netflix. This is for the middle class.” Teffo said they  were available to engage the company in  court, but it should be another court. “Not this one. Here we are dealing with criminal procedures.” Prosecutor advocate George Baloyi also expressed concern, saying that after making the documentary, the production company  opened the floodgates to public speculation on who they think killed Meyiwa. “They should be barred from further proceedings in court and flighting any more documentaries,” he said. Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela said there  had been complaints that when counsel spoke  to their clients they were  being followed by cameras,  saying  it cannot be allowed. The former Bafana Bafana goalkeeper was  shot dead in October 2014 in what was described as a botched robbery in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg. The matter continues.
