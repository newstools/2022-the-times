Ten men involved in the fatal Rosettenville, Johannesburg, shoot-out appeared in court  on Wednesday on  charges of murder and  attempted murder. They also faced charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, possession of explosives, possession of hijacked vehicles and conspiracy to commit a cash-in-transit robbery. The suspects, aged between 35 and 67, are Sihle Mazibuko, Qaphela Ngubeni, Menzi Shabalala, and Hloniphani Dube, Alex Matshebele, Phendula Mvubu, Mike Ngwadi, Andrew Tshobolo, Khulekani Nkosi and Kitso Mnguni. According to Hawks spokesperson Brig Thandi Mbambo, the 10 were part of a group of at least 25 suspects accosted during a multidisciplinary crime intelligence-led operation which included the national CIT task team in Moffatview. The case has been postponed to March 3 2022 for verification of addresses and the legal status of foreigners among them. It is alleged that on Monday officers  were following up information on  suspects planning to commit a cash in transit robbery in the Johannesburg area. The information led them to a  house at  50 Friars Hill Street in Rosetenville, where the suspects had allegedly met for their final planning session. A police helicopter hovered  above the  house while other officers  took up positions on the ground, Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesperson  Grace Langa said. "When the suspects noticed the helicopter  they started shooting at it  and the police in  the helicopter  retaliated by shooting back at the suspects. The officers  on the ground joined in and the suspects continued shooting at the police officers. The suspects tried to escape from the house, some on foot, others in  vehicles, and others jumped over  walls to  neighbouring houses. "Eight suspects were fatally wounded and declared dead at the  scene. One of the deceased suspects is an ex-military member," Langa said. TimesLIVE
