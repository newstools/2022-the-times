Though his official birthday was on February 11, he held the private shindig to celebrate his trip around the sun. A Twitter handle account by the name of Nasty C Charts and Universal Music Group shared snaps of the night. Naturally the hip-hop cats were there to celebrate with the star. Among the guests were people from the rap industry.

Taking to Instagram, he shared his latest achievement as his new song, "Stalling" is on number  three across all genres. “We’re number  across all genres. Thank you to everybody listening to #Stalling . I hope that if you relate to it, it’s because of something that happened long ago & not recently.”
