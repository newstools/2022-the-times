“There was no need for a budget speech. The minister of finance should have just said we’re still broke and will be for a very long time.” This is one of the remarks from people online who expressed mixed reactions to Enoch Godongwana’s first budget speech. Godongwana delivered his much-anticipated budget speech in parliament on Wednesday. He warned the country is still a long way from a sustainable economic recovery and that spending must still be monitored. “The improved revenue performance is not a reflection of an improvement in the capacity of our economy. “As such, we cannot plan permanent expenditure on the basis of short-term increases in commodity prices. To be clear, any permanent increases in spending should be financed in a way that does not worsen the fiscal deficit,” he said. Godongwana said the budget deficit is projected to narrow from 5.7% in 2021/22 to 4.2% of GDP in 2024/25. Economic growth has been revised downwards from 5.1% to 4.8% in 2021. Real GDP growth of 2.1% is projected for 2022. The government expects to collect R182bn more than earlier estimated in tax revenue. It plans to use R44bn to extend the R350 Covid-19 relief of distress grant by another 12 months, and support job creation projects. Public debt accounted for 69.5% of GDP in 2021/22 and will increase steadily over the next three years before stabilising at 75.1% of GDP (R5.4-trillion) in 2024/25. Dozens took to social media to weigh in on the budget. Some said the speech was “refreshing”, despite Godongwana not scrapping E-tolls. Others said the speech was “very uninspiring”. Here is a snapshot of what some had to say:
