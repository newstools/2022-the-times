City Power will carry out urgent maintenance on two transformers starting next Saturday, and as a result large parts of Johannesburg will experience reduced water supply. Johannesburg Water said water supply operations would be affected on February 19 for nine hours,  from 6.30am to 3.30pm,  while City Power works on the 1B transformer. A second round of maintenance will take place on March 5 for nine hours, also  from 6.30am to 3.30pm, on the 2B transformer at the Rand Water Eikenhof pump station. As a result the water supply from Eikenhof   station will be reduced by 33% and 40% respectively during these times. Johannesburg Water said    residents south of the CBD and in the northern and western areas of Johannesburg will experience poor to no water supply during peak water demand periods. High-lying and high demand areas will be most affected. The water entity  said it would provide alternative supplies in  the form of stationary and roaming water tankers to reduce the affect on consumers. Affected areas will be: Roodepoort/Randburg area: Langlaagte/Southdale area: Soweto areas: TimesLIVE
