Social media has been filled with reaction for former finance minister Tito Mboweni after news  the politician is retiring from public office. Mboweni’s resignation from parliament comes almost six months after he left President Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet in August last year. Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said Mboweni submitted his resignation letter on Monday. He said National Assembly speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula wished Mboweni well in his retirement from parliament. “Mr Tito Mboweni has handed his resignation as MP in the National Assembly to speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. The resignation is effective from today,  January 31 2022. The speaker wishes the former minister well on his retirement,” said Mothapo. Mboweni  confirmed the news on social media and said  he would not be doing interviews. “It is true  I have informed the speaker  that I am leaving parliament. Surely that cannot be breaking news. Really? Going back to the private sector. No interviews, please,” he said. The news comes  days after Mboweni shared  he was preparing for a “job interview”. He did not share what position he was being interviewed for but mentioned he was asked for his CV, fingerprints and certificates. “Job interviews. Today I was preparing for a job interview.  They want my CV, certificates and fingerprints before the interview. What? I thought everybody knows me. Nope. Stand in line, buddy. Certificates, fingerprints and CV. Next week, interview!” BusinessLIVE reported  Mboweni will be joining property fund 6 company Accelerate as an independent non-executive director and chair. As news of his departure circulated online, many  shared their thoughts. Some applauded Mboweni for a job well done, while others joked he can now focus more on his cooking  and doing the things he loves. Here is a snapshot of some of the reactions:
