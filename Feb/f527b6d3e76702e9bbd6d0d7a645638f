Western Cape premier Alan Winde says “imminent” changes will be made to the province’s existing liquor laws. Speaking during his state of the province address this week, Winde said  significant amendments to the laws have been granted “principle approval”. He said the amendments follow a previous commitment by the province to help curb alcohol abuse. “Our provincial cabinet has  granted in-principle approval for the first set of amendments to the Western Cape Liquor Amendment Bill to be drafted. “Drafting instructions are  in an advanced stage and should be completed imminently. The next steps will include a full Regulatory Impact Assessment process of the second set of proposed amendments to the bill,” said Winde. He said the two-step amendment process is to ensure  “quick-win amendments” can be made as soon as possible and not be delayed by more significant changes that will require an extensive public participation process. He said amendment to the liquor laws will not ban alcohol or hurt the economy. “I want to make a commitment that our approach to tackling alcohol-related harms will not be done in a way that hurts the economy and costs jobs. We simply cannot afford that in the current economic climate,” he said. “However, we cannot let the status quo continue either. We must be innovative and targeted in our approach so  we end this deadly relationship once and for all.” Changes  drafted under the amended act include:
