Motorists in Tshwane have been urged to avoid “risky behaviour” as the Gauteng metro experiences severe storms and flooding. Tshwane emergency services spokesperson deputy chief Charles Mabaso said  with rain continuing throughout the day on Friday, low-lying bridges in various parts of the city had been flooded. “The Centurion area is experiencing flooding of low-lying water bridges, like the Rabie and End street bridges, the Blackwood low water bridge, as well as the Irene Farm low-water bridge. “As such, we are calling on residents and drivers in the area to avoid crossing the low-lying water bridges,” said Mabaso. He said shortly after 10am on Friday, an SUV was stuck on the Blackwood low-water bridge.  The vehicle was later recovered by a tow truck. The occupant and the driver  were safe. “This is risky behaviour, where motorists try to cross low-water bridges when they are flooded. We discourage it in the strongest terms,” he said. Drivers returning from work in the Daveyton  area were also delayed due to flooding on Kingsway road. Besides flooding, Tshwane also had to contend with trees falling over. A Jacaranda tree, a species for which the city is renowned,  fell onto a residential boundary wall. Like Johannesburg, the city's canopy is ageing and the soft-bark Jacarandas are at risk during severe storms. Meanwhile, the SA Weather Service pointed out  that while Cyclone Batsirai was forming off the African coast, the local storms being experienced are not connected to the phenomenon. TimesLIVE
