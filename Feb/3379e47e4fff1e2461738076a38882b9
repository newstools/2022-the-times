A video of members of the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) marching to Zakes Bantwini's hit song Osama is circulating on social media and has  set a vibe for the 2022 state of the nation address (Sona). The video shows members of the SANDF marching to Osama during a practice parade in Cape Town.

The National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (Natjoints) has warned against attempts to  disrupt proceedings. Here are some of the reactions: TimesLIVE
