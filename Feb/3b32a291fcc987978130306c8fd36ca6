Your warm heart and coal burnt voice. The experience I've had with you will forever be cherished. I love you ntwana yam.” he wrote. “With you (Mpura) I didn't lose a friend or an acquaintance but someone who became a brother. I'm still saying it hurts. I miss you.” The self-proclaimed first lady of amapiano Lady Du has also been keeping the memory of the pair alive. She showcased her new ink on Instagram when she posted a picture of her arm with a tattoo of two birds, a peace sign and hearts. “Peace magents,” she wrote.
