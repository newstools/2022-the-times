Royal AM have signed Brazilian centreback Ricardo Nascimento from Mamelodi Sundowns. The wealthy Durban club made the announcement in the form of a video on their official Facebook account featuring flamboyant owner Shauwn Mkhize welcoming the left-footed defender  to the club. “Guys, I have yet another surprise for you. I'm trying to make sure  the team Royal AM is strengthened,” Mkhize said. “I've started with wingers, fast-paced. I went from the wingers to the strikers. And now I'm coming to the core — I'm strengthening my defence. “Nascimento, bem-vindo ao [welcome to] Royal AM.” Nascimento, 35, signed for Downs from Brazil’s Atletico Monte Azul in June 2016. He became a stalwart in the Pretoria club’s defence and is a reliable penalty-taker, scoring 17 goals in 139 league and cup appearances. Plagued by injuries he  was fielded just six times — all in the DStv Premiership — in 2021-22. Royal AM, who bought the franchise of Bloemfontein Celtic in the off-season, are in seventh place after 17 games in the Premiership.
