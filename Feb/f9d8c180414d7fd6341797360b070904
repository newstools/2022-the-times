The long-held belief that “your brand is only as good as your reputation” has never been more true than it is today, when a company's actions are quick to elicit a reaction from consumers and employees alike on social media. The onus is on established and popular brands, such as the Gautrain, to be the best they can be — both in and out of the workplace. But what makes some businesses “cooler” than others? What sets them apart, making them companies that people want to work for? These questions will be explored in the first of a series of four TimesLIVE Dialogues, in partnership with the Gautrain Management Agency, on March 1. During this event, host Joanne Joseph, a well-known media personality, and Dr Barbara Jensen, senior executive manager: Communication & Marketing at the Gautrain Management Agency, will unpack: Register now and you'll go into a lucky draw where you'll stand a chance to win one of two prizes: a R500 Gautrain voucher and a R1,000 Takealot voucher. *If you would like to attend this event in person, email Michelle Rodrigues at Rodriguesm@arena.africa This article was paid for by the Gautrain Management Agency.
