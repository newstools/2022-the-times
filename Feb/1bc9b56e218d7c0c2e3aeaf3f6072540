KwaZulu-Natal police said on Friday they are treating the threat of a planned shutdown of main highways in the province as serious. TimesLIVE reported on Thursday that All Truck Drivers Forum and Allied SA (ATDF ASA) secretary-general Sifiso Nyathi confirmed that some drivers were planning a shutdown on Sunday over the hiring of foreign truck drivers. The N2 and N3 highways have been targeted in past protests. On Friday, a truck was used to block the R102 between Mandeni and Gingindlovu in northern KZN. The scene has been cleared, according to local authorities. Police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele said: “The SAPS treats all threats as serious and  will deploy police officers and necessary resources to curb such threats.” TimesLIVE
