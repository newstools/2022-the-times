KwaZulu-Natal is on the way to economic recovery after the July 2021 unrest that brought the province to its knees, says premier Sihle Zikalala. In his state of the province address on Thursday, Zikalala said the government was promoting the province, engaging the diplomatic community to assure them of its stability and creating a conducive environment for international investment. “The KZN government is  working with other spheres of government to give comfort to investors that Mooi River is a safe area to invest in. “The Mpofana municipality must benefit from investment in agriculture, an agri-hub for agro-processing, clothing, textiles and agro-process,” he said. During the  unrest about 26 trucks were set alight near the Mooi River toll plaza. Zikalala said things were looking up for economic recovery. The provincial government had worked closely with development finance institutions (DFIs) to assist businesses affected by the unrest. Milestones achieved included: Zikalala said at the end of December 2021 (Q3) the procurement spend by provincial departments was R26.032bn. Of this R10.34bn was on companies from KwaZulu-Natal. On the unrest itself, he  said the killings in Phoenix were painful and polarising and must never be repeated. “While the prosecution of those alleged to be involved in these crimes continues, we are  engaging communities in reconciliation and healing.” TimesLIVE
