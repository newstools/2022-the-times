President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for mediation and engagement to end the  war  unfolding between Russia and Ukraine, which is threatening to lead to what some suggest will be “World War 3". Ramaphosa was addressing the Intergovernmental National Litigation Forum in Pretoria on Friday. His call comes after international relations and co-operation minister Naledi Pandor urged Russia to immediately withdraw from Ukraine. Many other  nations, including the US and  the UK, and the UN, have condemned the invasion  and have responded with  sanctions. “We can see  the war going on in Ukraine. I would say that conflict  should be subjected to mediation, to negotiation, to engagement because it is not necessary for people to go to war and see people  killed and infrastructure  damaged. “It behoves on all countries of the world, particularly the  UN Security Council. They are the ones who should be getting more  engaged in a mediation process and one does not see that happening. One does not see that full engagement,” said Ramaphosa. “It is not necessary for people to  be killed when the  options of mediation,  negotiation and engagement  are available.” His words echoed the country’s initial reaction to the war  when it called for dialogue with a spirit of compromise.
