The first part of the state capture  inquiry report was released on January 4  this year. Its 800 pages are not light reading.  Other than journalists and those directly involved, not many people have made it through the full document. The first part of the report is divided into three sections. The first deals with SAA and related companies, the second with Gupta-owned  media, and the third with  the SA Revenue Service and “public procurement in SA”. TimesLIVE Video takes a look at the  highlights to get you up to date before the second part of the report  is revealed later today. TimesLIVE
