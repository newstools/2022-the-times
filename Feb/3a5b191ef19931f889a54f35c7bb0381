Cape Town police dispersed a small group of protesters who had gathered at the corner of Darling and Corporation streets hoping to tell President Cyril Ramaphosa their grievances before  the state of the nation address on Thursday evening. The residents, some  from the Cape Flats, had hoped to get a glimpse of Ramaphosa on the red carpet in front of the Cape Town city hall. One of about 100 people, Ntombise Simelani, told TimesLIVE  she wanted to plead with Ramaphosa for work. “Tata, please help us with permanent employment. We are here because we were part of the Walking Bus project since 2016 on a voluntary basis. The new mayor wants to get rid of the project because there is no need for our services,” said Simelani. She said she wanted her job back. “We want the president to see how the mayor of Cape Town is treating us. We want permanent jobs because this is not a job  you can stop. “If I  see the president I would tell him, ‘Tata, we are begging you, please try to get us employment’. “We take the children to school and return them  to their homes in the afternoon so  they do not get run over by vehicles,” she said. The community  claimed they were told  this service would be provided by law enforcement officers. Selimi Voontjies said she hoped  Ramaphosa would intervene by speaking to the new Cape Town mayor. “We are crying out loud but they are not hearing us. We leave  our homes at 4am to take  children to school. Since we started there have been  fewer children raped and murdered. We are mothers and grandmothers. We are willing to give up our lives for the children.” Another resident told TimesLIVE  she was told  she needed to produce a qualification for the service. “That’s wrong and we will not do that. We do not  get a budget from  his office. He does not care about us. He only cares about roads, water and houses.” TimesLIVE
