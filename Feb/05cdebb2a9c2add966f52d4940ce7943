Beneficiaries of the R350 social relief of distress (SRD) grant who used their phones to apply for only one grant can collect  it from any Pick n Pay or Boxer supermarket this week. This is according to the SA Post Office (Sapo),  which urged beneficiaries to make use of the collection points at the two supermarkets. In a statement, Sapo  said the first week, until February 8, is reserved for the payment of old age, disability and child grants. Sapo advised beneficiaries to wait until they have received an SMS confirming their grant is available before going to collect their money. “Beneficiaries whose phones were used to apply for only one grant can collect the grant from any Pick n Pay or Boxer supermarket. If a phone was used to apply for more than one grant, it can only be collected from a post office. This does not apply to beneficiaries who chose to receive their grant in a bank account,” said Sapo. “SRD grants are payable until the end of March. However, beneficiaries who have not yet received their grants need not be concerned. Payments will be made at post office branches at least until June to make sure all outstanding grants are paid.” Those who collect at the post office are urged to note that the day they collect their grant is determined by the last three digits of their ID number. Here is when you can collect your R350 grant at the post office: February 9: 082 and 087 February 10: 083 and 088 February 11: 084 and 089 February 14: 080 and 085 February 15: 081 and 086 February 16: 082 and 087 February 17: 083 and 088 February 18: 084 and 089 February 21: 080 and 085 February 22: 081 and 086 February 23: 082 and 087 February 24: 083 and 088 February 25: 084 and 089 February 28: 080 and 085
