South Africans are eagerly awaiting the start of the  state of the nation address (Sona) at 7pm on Thursday. President Cyril Ramaphosa  will deliver the address, which will include his plans to bring  about change in the country. EFF secretary-general Marshall Dlamini  told the media  the change of venue was forced on them by the incompetence of the ANC. “We are not supposed to be here. We’re supposed to be in parliament. We know we don’t have government. We  have people who  go there  for salaries and to drink alcohol. It is incompetence that has brought us here,” he said. The Sona is being held in Cape Town’s city hall after a fire damaged buildings in the parliamentary precinct last month EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu   said: “Generally there’s a crisis and things are getting worse. Literally everything under Ramaphosa is collapsing in this country.  Ramaphosa is not steering the ship in the right direction.” People turned out in large numbers as pressure and anger mounted outside  city hall, with  grievances ranging from safety to meaningful change.
