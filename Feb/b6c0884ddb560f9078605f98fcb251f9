SA retailer Massmart Holdings flagged on Friday a wider annual loss, hurt by store damages and lower trading income  due to looting in the civil unrest in July last year. The retailer, majority-owned by Walmart, said it expects its 2021 headline loss per share, the main profit measure in SA, to come in between 684.2 cents and 726.8 cents, at least 60.3% wider than the loss of 426.8 cents reported in 2020.
