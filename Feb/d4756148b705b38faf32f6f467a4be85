The SA Post Office (Sapo) is in arrears on rentals, utilities and operational costs with R304m owed  due to the troubled state-owned entity’s constrained cash flow. This is as of the  end of January 2022. The information was revealed by communications and digital technologies minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni in reply to a written parliamentary question by FF Plus MP Wouter Wessels.

Sapo  developed a revised strategy to improve its operational and financial performance  and is implementing it,” said Ntshavheni, adding that the  company has requested government intervention through the medium-term expenditure framework process.

Barnes laid out his plan to save Sapo from collapse in a column published in Business Day earlier this month, saying he had presented the proposal to government in September 2021 and never got a response. In the column, he shared a letter he had written to Ntshavheni calling for a public-private partnership to save the ailing Sapo, a “strategic asset of national importance”. “I believe I still have the support of all principal stakeholders in the post office, including the employees and unions (despite detractors, as there may still be within the department) and I believe that with an appropriate structure and the right leadership the post office can provide the prospect of economic dignity to its people directly and be a bridge between government and the population to address poverty, unemployment and inequality  like no other organisation is positioned to do.” His eight-point proposal was: TimesLIVE
