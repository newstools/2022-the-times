The body of a woman  was discovered by a search and rescue team in the Olifantspruit in Tshwane on Wednesday. Tshwane emergency services spokesperson Charles Mabaso said the team believed she was one of the passengers in an e-hailing taxi washed away  in Midstream on Saturday. Police and other authorities have been searching parts of Tshwane for missing people after a storm on Friday caused flooding in the area. The woman's body was found at about 11.50am. Two people are still missing — the driver of the e-hailing taxi and another passenger. Teams are continuing the search towards Centurion Lake. This brings the numbers of bodies recovered to five.
