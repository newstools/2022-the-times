Eating healthy and nutritious foods during the Covid-19 pandemic is beneficial for the immune system. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says while none of the healthy foods, including fruits and vegetables, prevents the transmission of Covid-19, maintaining a healthy diet is vital. “The immune system requires the support of many nutrients. It is recommended to consume a variety of foods for a healthy and balanced diet, including whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts and animal source foods,” says the WHO. It added there is no evidence supporting claims that people can get Covid-19 from eating fruits and vegetables. “There is currently no evidence that people can catch Covid-19 from food, including fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruits and vegetables are part of a healthy diet and their consumption should be encouraged.” It said washing fruits and vegetables if they are eaten raw is important. “Wash fruit and vegetables the same way you would in any other circumstance. Before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw,” said the organisation.
