AfriForum's case against EFF members for singing “Kill the Boer” started in the Gauteng high court in Johannesburg on Monday. Listen: Ernst Roets from AfriForum, the author of the book Kill the Boer: Government Complicity in SA's Brutal Farm Murders, read  sections of the book and answered questions in  court. Roets said Julius Malema's denial  of farm murders is upsetting and very reckless. AfriForum is taking the party to court over the singing of the song “dubul' ibhulu” (“Kill the Boer”) by party leader Julius Malema. AfriForum is arguing that this is hate speech. The secretary-general of the EFF, Marshall Mzingisi Dlamini, said the case was a waste of time and state resources and Roets was in court to “promote his book”. The SG said it  was irritating to sit in court over a bored AfriForum that is in court to promote Roets' book. TimesLIVE
