There is no money. This was finance minister Enoch  Godongwana’s response when asked whether he had the budget to implement what President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce during his state of the nation address tonight. “I can tell you  it’s going to cost me a lot,” said Godongwana, chuckling. He told the media  he suspected that whatever Ramaphosa  would announce would dent his budget. “There is no money, but the president is the head of state and his duty is to outline the direction  we will be taking this year. Therefore, we will have to find resources in line with that direction," he said. The minister would not be drawn  to comment about what Ramaphosa  would say in the address. Regarding the R350  social relief of distress  grant, with calls for this to be expanded to a basic income grant, he said  whatever Ramaphosa  announces would inform the direction he took on February 23 when he delivers the budget speech. On the country’s current economic outlook, he said: “The economic outlook for the year ahead is bad. The economic measures have been revised down as a result of what happened in July last year.” He was making reference to the riots and looting in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng which left more than 300 people dead and took more than R50bn off the  economy. “If the economic outlook is bad, it has an impact on  revenue.” TimesLIVE
