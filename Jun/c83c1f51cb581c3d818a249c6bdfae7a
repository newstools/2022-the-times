The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) says the immunity people get from getting sick with Covid-19 is not better than that people get when vaccinated for the virus. “Getting a Covid-19 vaccine is a safer and more dependable way to build immunity against Covid-19 than getting sick with Covid-19,” said the institute. The World Health Organisation (WHO) in its interim statement on hybrid and other forms of Covid-19 immunity says infection-induced immunity is less effective than vaccine-induced immunity, which offers protection months after vaccine doses have been administered. The International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities and the WHO recently issued updated guidelines for healthcare workers about the Covid-19 vaccine. It said the initial Covid-19 jabs (two doses of Pfizer or one of J&J) offer more than 75% protection from serious illness, hospitalisation and death. This protection can last for about six months. That protection is extended for several more months with a booster shot. “While those who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 following primary vaccination typically experience milder illness, protection against the level of severity of infection does seem to decrease over time without a booster vaccination.” WHERE CAN I GET MY BOOSTER SHOT?
