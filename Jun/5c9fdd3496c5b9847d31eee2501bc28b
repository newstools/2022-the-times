Business owners and the community are  reeling after 23 stalls at the Yeoville Market were destroyed by fire  as an investigation gets under way. Johannesburg emergency management services  spokesperson Nana Radebe-Kgiba said the blaze  was extinguished in the early hours of Tuesday. The cause of the fire could not be immediately  determined due to the extent of the damage. “Two fire engines and a water tanker from Fairview and Malvern fire stations were dispatched and found part of the market engulfed  in fire.” Gauteng police spokesperson Lt-Col Mavela Masondo said an investigation had been opened. “Police received a phone call from an anonymous [person] saying  Yeoville Market is on fire. On arrival at the market, the police found firefighters  extinguishing about five stalls that were burning. The cause of the fire cannot be confirmed at this stage.” Advocacy group the African Diaspora Forum said they were  seeking clarity on the origin of the blaze  which affected many foreigners. There has been speculation that it could have been motivated by xenophobia or was caused by an electrical appliance. “We  suspect [arson] because of the number of migrant communities in Yeoville,” said forum chairperson Dr Vusumuzi Sibanda. Sibanda voiced concern about foreigners  being  victimised. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
