Parliament descended into chaos for the second day running on  Friday morning as EFF MPs continued to disrupt proceedings during debate on the presidency budget vote. Members of the EFF went as far as alleging that National Assembly speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula allowed sexual harassment to take place as EFF members were escorted from parliament for similar disruptions during President Cyril Ramaphosa's speech on Thursday. Various  EFF MPs were  escorted out of the Good Hope Chamber  for  unruly behaviour. One of the  MPs, Sinawo Tambo, said:  “Ramaphosa has breached his oath of office, he has contravened the [Prevention and] Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, he has contravened the [Prevention of] Organised Crime Act.” Ramaphosa has denied any wrongdoing. He says the money stolen from his Limpopo farm  was the proceeds of legitimate livestock sales. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
