The department received tip-offs from the public who alerted it to corrupt branches in their communities. “Members of the public have come out in large numbers to tell us where corruption is taking place. We arrest, we don't stop. In the coming weeks we will continue to arrest more people,  foreign nationals and South Africans involved in passport fraud and other forms of identity fraud. “We continue to be concerned about those South Africans who are willing to sell their identities. Such acts mean that those South Africans lose their status in the country, to be replaced by a foreign national. We urge South Africans to stop selling their identities.” Motsoaledi said the department  would beef up its team of investigators and analysts  responsible for tracking and investigating corruption and fraud in the department. “The success of this unit has given members of the public confidence.” Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
