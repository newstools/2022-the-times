The Western Cape Serious and Violent Crime Investigation Unit has been assigned to probe the circumstances surrounding the murder of four men, who were gunned down at a house in Tulbach. Col Andrè Traut said the shooting occurred at around 9pm on Saturday night. An unknown number of suspects approached a group of people comprising six males and three females who were socializing at a residence in Jooste Street, and opened fire at the victims, he said. Four males aged 30, 32,33, and 37 were killed and a fifth male was admitted to hospital. The three females and one male escaped the attack unharmed. Police have offered a reward of R100,000 for information that leads to the arrest of the perpetrators.
