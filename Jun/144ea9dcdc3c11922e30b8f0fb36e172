A man has appeared in court in the Eastern Cape on charges related to dealing in commercial explosives allegedly used in ATM bombings and cash-in-transit heists. Makalo Bartholomy Hadebe, 47, from Motsekula location, appeared in the Matatiele magistrate’s court on Thursday. “This emanates from his arrest by the East London-based Hawks’ serious organised crime investigation team, K9 unit, crime intelligence and public order policing on June 8,” said Hawks spokesperson Capt Yolisa Mgolodela. “The arrest emanates from an intelligence-driven operation where two successful test purchases of  explosives were done. The seized explosives are believed to be used in automated teller machine (ATM) bombings and cash-in-transit (CIT) robberies.” Hadebe’s case was postponed to June 14 for a bail application. Hawks Eastern Cape head Maj-Gen Mboiki Obed Ngwenya lauded the team for their efforts to eradicate CIT and ATM robberies. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
