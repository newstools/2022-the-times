A 16-year-old Mpumalanga girl has been arrested for allegedly killing her two-week-old baby and hiding the  body in her schoolbag. Brig Selvy Mohlala said the baby's grandmother woke to find  the baby girl missing in the early hours of Thursday morning. “She asked the baby's mother about the child's whereabouts, but she apparently refused to speak.” The granny contacted police, who questioned the Ehlanzeni teenager. “She [allegedly] admitted  she killed the baby and stuffed her body in a schoolbag. She  led the police to the room where she hid the  bag and was  arrested,” Mohlala said. The teen is expected to appear in court soon. Provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Semakaleng Manamela said the crime was  “tragic and unfortunate” and urged young mothers to seek assistance from relevant organisations if they are struggling to cope.
