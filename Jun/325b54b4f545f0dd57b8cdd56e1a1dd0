Seasoned Durban angler Jace Govender hooked and released a 150kg grey shark  at the weekend. But the  huge predator was small compared to his biggest catch — a 410kg shark he caught last year. Govender is among an elite group of fishermen who have caught  more than 300kg of fish from the shore. With the annual sardine run under way and the shark nets lifted by the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board,  sightings and catch and release of  predators  have increased over the past few days. “We have just witnessed a shoal of sardines in Amanzimtoti, south of Durban, which is about 10km long. “There are sardines  at the central beaches but nobody has netted there yet.” Govender said bathing  was banned along the entire coastline because of the shark nets being lifted. The sharks are not interested in humans and  are focused on feeding on the sardines. “They gulp hundreds of kilograms at a time. They don't care about humans. All they want to do is eat the sardines. That's why they migrate with them. We have been swimming with sharks  daily. There have been sharks all around us. “If they don’t attack us in the deep, I can't see them attacking people in the shallows.” But Govender warned people to be careful and stay out of the water. “There could be a case of mistaken identity. If you know bathing is banned, stay away from the water.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
