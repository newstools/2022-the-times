It is a source of constant irritation that the taxpayer  foots the bill for frivolous legal action taken by government officials. Cases in point are  suspended public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and former president Jacob Zuma. , Despite repeated judgments against them, they continue to pursue their futile quests at the cost of the taxpayer. My proposal would be for them to personally pay their legal costs until they win their cases and then claim from the state. Similarly, officials who are put on suspension should get a “subsistence” salary until they are proven innocent. There should be no fuel, vehicle, cellphone, entertainment or other allowances. Should they be found guilty, those “subsistence” costs are  deducted from their pension pay-outs. The taxpayer is being fleeced by the callous actions of these accused people and should stop forthwith. Ron Claassens Umgeni, KwaZulu-Natal • You too can join the discussion.
