There were further delays in the handing over of the final state capture report to President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday. While Ramaphosa had been expected to receive the report from  chief justice and commission chairperson Raymond Zondo at the Union  Buildings at 4pm, proceedings were yet to get under way after 5pm. TimesLIVE was reliably informed that the delays had to do with a "technicality" relating to the documentation. Proceedings were now expected to start at about 7pm. The final instalment  was initially meant to be delivered at the end of April, but Zondo had headed to court  at the time and said the commission would not be able to deliver all the outstanding sections of the report by then. The court  granted him an extension to last week but, again, his office gave the presidency reasons  why it could not deliver. This is a developing story.
