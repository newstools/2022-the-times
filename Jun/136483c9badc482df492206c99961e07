The family of a six-year-old boy who fell into a sewerage manhole on Sunday have been told by  rescue divers to prepare for the worst. The search and rescue team from Johannesburg emergency services (EMS) returned to the site in Dlamini, Soweto,  on Tuesday in a bid to find Khayalethu Magadla who is believed to have fallen into a manhole not far from his home while  playing soccer with his friends. As the search for his body  entered day two, EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said the chances of finding the boy alive were slim and the operation had now been declared a search and recovery. “Looking at the time frame of the incident, it's been three days since  it was reported, hence we say the chances of finding him alive are very slim. “We also briefed the family and they've assured us  they understand and they just want us to bring their son's remains so they can find closure.” The rescue teams comprising police divers, firefighters and engineers moved from one area to another in Soweto searching the sewerage pipes and hoping for a breakthrough. The  system is said to be  huge, flowing from Meadowlands  to the Olifantsvlei water purification plant. The manholes in the area are 1.8m  deep and 1.2m wide with water moving as fast as 11km/h, presenting a challenge for divers who have to be  careful when entering. Rescuers also used cameras  to search the stormwater pipes. Mulaudzi said while it was not clear when  the body would be recovered, the search teams had  promised  the family  they would bring their son home.
