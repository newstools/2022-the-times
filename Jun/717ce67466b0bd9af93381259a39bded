US drummer and Kourtney Kardashian’s husband Travis Barker has reportedly been hospitalised with an unknown medical issue. The Blink-182 member was seen being transported to a Los Angeles, California, medical centre after “suffering from a mysterious medical issue”, according to Daily Mail. In the snaps, the drummer is seen on a stretcher  being loaded into an ambulance  with Kardashian by his side. It's  unclear what the medical condition is or what his  status is, but his 16-year-old daughter Alabama took to Instagram to ask fans to “send prayers”, seemingly in reference to her father’s condition. Barker, 46, wed the reality star in  May in a lavish affair in Italy. The couple said “I do” at L’Olivetta, a villa owned by Dolce & Gabbana in Portofino, in a ceremony attended by the Kardashian-Jenner clan and close friends of the couple. This is Kardashian’s first marriage and Barker’s third. Kardashian, 42, was in an on-and-off relationship with Scott Disick for years and the union resulted in three children. Barker has two children with ex-wife Shanna Moakler. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
