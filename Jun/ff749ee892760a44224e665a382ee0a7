A taxi driver who used his vehicle to transport looters during the July 2021 unrest in KwaZulu-Natal has been sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The Durban regional court convicted Lungelo Nthenga, 24,  after he pleaded guilty to three counts of theft. His conviction relates to incidents in the Mobeni industrial area in July 2021, during the unprecedented looting which engulfed the province. In his guilty plea, Nthenga told the court he was a taxi driver during the unrest. He had used a vehicle to transport people to loot at a site in the Mobeni business industrial area, along South Coast road.
