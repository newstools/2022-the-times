Eskom has announced that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding from 5pm on Monday night. The announcement was made on Monday, just hours after the power utility said  it was fighting to keep the lights on. In a statement, Eskom said load-shedding would begin at 5pm and end at 10pm. “Due to the continued shortage of generation capacity, load-shedding will be implemented every evening at the same time until Thursday night,” it said.
