Johannesburg residents witnessed debris believed to be from a Russian space rocket falling to earth on Sunday night. Carmel Ives, vice-chairperson of the Astronomical Society of SA (Assa), said she spotted the “space junk” deorbiting from Midrand at 10.56pm. Ives said it was from a Russian SL-4 rocket upper stage. “You can tell  it is  space junk because of the speed at which it moves. “It is space junk rather than a meteor as it is moving slowly, at 20,000 to 30,000km/h,  and breaks up into several pieces. Meteors travel at 70,000 to 80,000km/h  and appear as a single streak,” she said. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
