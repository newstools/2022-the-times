The EFF said on Friday it had opened a criminal case of assault against speaker of the National Assembly Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. EFF members were forcibly removed from the National Assembly chamber by parliament's protection officers during the presidency’s budget vote on Thursday. "The members of parliament who were subjected to Mapisa-Nqakula's tyranny in service of [President Cyril] Ramaphosa, have opened a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and sexual assault against Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, and the so-called parliament protection services," the EFF said in a statement. The party urged police to speedily act on the case it opened. “The EFF will pursue private prosecutions against [the] speaker and the parliament protection services if there is nothing done about the cases we have opened.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
