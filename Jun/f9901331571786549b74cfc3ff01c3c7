Two days after the  government confirmed  law enforcement authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have arrested Rajesh and Atul Gupta,  SA’s political parties, while welcoming the arrests, have questioned  the  timing of the news.Listen to what they had to say: The Gupta brothers are accused in SA of profiting from close links with former president Jacob Zuma and exerting unfair influence. Their arrests follow the issuing of a red notice by the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) at the beginning of March. The news of the arrests arrived  days after President Cyril Ramaphosa was accused of allegedly hatching a plan to cover up a crime  at his Limpopo farm  when thieves made off with millions in foreign currency  kept there. The allegations were made by former spy boss Arthur Fraser, who  has laid charges against Ramaphosa. The president  has since publicly stated  he was not involved in any criminal activity. Leaders within the DA, EFF and GOOD parties have said  the timing of the news is suspicious, with some going so far as to say  the arrests are being used to divert  attention away from the allegations facing the  president. The arrests have paved the way for SA to start the extradition process  for the two Gupta brothers. Extradition is often a time-consuming and drawn-out process consisting of complicated legal steps and a plethora of potential legal challenges.
