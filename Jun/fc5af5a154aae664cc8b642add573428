The Randburg magistrate’s court has dismissed the discharge application brought by EFF leader Julius Malema and  MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. They had brought a section 174 application arguing that the state does not have sufficient evidence for a conviction. The case is set to resume after a short  adjournment. Defence advocate Laurence Hodes SC said  Malema and Ndlozi are ready to testify. They are charged with assaulting a police officer, Lt-Col Johannes Jacobus Venter, at the funeral of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in April 2018. They have pleaded not guilty.
