A mass funeral service will be held next  Wednesday for the 21 young people who died  in an Eastern Cape tavern on Sunday morning. The  provincial government said that thereafter the families would be helped  with transportation of the remains to be interred at burial sites of their choice. The government on Wednesday  thanked those who had promised support in preparation for the funeral. “Among them is Avbob,   the funeral parlour, which has pledged burial costs support for each family.” The government  said autopsies  had been performed on all the deceased and samples sent to a laboratory in the Western Cape for investigation. “The report will be shared with the affected families as soon as investigations have been concluded.” The government  said  police remained on scene and continued to comb the scene for further clues in relation to the incident.
