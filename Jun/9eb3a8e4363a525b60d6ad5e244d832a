The flood-damaged R102 in Compensation, between Tongaat and Ballito in KwaZulu-Natal, has claimed another vehicle. During this third incident, a hired vehicle driven by a woman who was not familiar with the area, landed on its side in the  hole in the road on Friday. Technicians who were working on installing fibre in the area helped the woman  out of the vehicle. At the end of April, a police van nosedived into the same  hole when concrete barriers  to warn motorists  the road had caved in were “maliciously removed”. On Monday DA councillor Yogis Govender  told TimesLIVE when the party had engaged with the provincial transport department on multiple issues relating to road repairs over the years, the department did not show a sense of urgency  to repair roads and bridges. He said the DA had expected the department to be more responsive after the  floods. “What we have seen from the department and the MEC is utterly disappointing. They have failed to make safe and monitor these main arterial routes, especially in Tongaat, despite bringing it to their attention many times. Vehicles have been plunging into these life-threatening road defects. “Two months later and they have done nothing except note the complaints. With past  experience, even fatalities do not spur this unit into any action,” Govender said. The KwaZulu-Natal transport department did not respond to a request for comment.
