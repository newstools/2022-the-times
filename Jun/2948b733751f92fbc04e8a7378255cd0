Born in Krugersdorp on September 24 1941, he worked for talk radio station 702 for many years, having started his broadcasting career at LM Radio in Mozambique in the 1960s after a stint as a reporter at the Germiston Advocate. He also worked for Swazi Music Radio, Springbok Radio, Capital Radio 604 Transkei and Radio 5. His prank show segments Fun Calls and Telephone Time on radio were among the country’s most popular shows.
