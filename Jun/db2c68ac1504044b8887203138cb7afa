I fully agree  that Eskom has failed and it must lose its licence. There are places  where people do not  pay for electricity at all,  but paying  customers are abused with load-shedding. In Duduza on Gauteng’s East Rand, we are load-shed from 4pm to 6pm. When the power returns, it goes  off again after two minutes and we stay in  darkness  until 10pm. Our children are hungry, crime thrives in darkness, and I have had enough of Eskom. We never had these problems before 2020 and it is getting worse. The government is failing us. Can the electricity problem be fixed? Enough is enough. Ntombi Mlambo Duduza • You too can join the discussion. Send your thoughts to letters@timeslive.co.za.
