The event will take place on  June 24 2022. Now in its eighth year, The Directors Event — sponsored by BCX and presented in association with the Institute of Directors SA — was created as an extension of the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Awards and will focus on the impact of Covid-19 on business and society. Sooliman will bring  lessons learnt from recent humanitarian crises to enable the government and business to drive the most effective paths to recovery. He will bring his understanding of SA’s livelihood crisis and will explain why it’s vital for the country to advance into a future underpinned by a greater ethos of social responsibility. The event will also tackle the importance of having a capable state  to tackle poverty and inequality, as well as the  connections between government and non-government funding of NGOs to enable the poor to escape  a cycle of poverty. In gaining a greater understanding of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on SA, Silke will examine the risks the conflict poses for the country.
