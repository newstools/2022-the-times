Actor Dumisani Dlamini wants tweeps to mind their own business as he continues to gush over his daughter, US rapper Doja Cat, real name Zandile Dlamini. The actor took to Instagram,  sharing shared a snippet of an interview Doja Cat did in 2019 after a concert in Las Vegas reacting to an old cassette of her father. Watch the video below: Speaking to TshisaLIVE in a 2017 interview, Dumisani revealed after the Sarafina! tour wrapped up he decided to stay in America and had two children with a Jewish-American woman, one of them being Doja Cat. After 15 years Dumisani  returned to SA and said his plans to bring his family with him were unsuccessful though he maintained contact with his children. “I am close to my children, all of them. I love them and they love me.” Though Dumisani  got a lot of backlash on social media for supposed lack of presence in Doja Cat's life, he  hinted  they are back on good terms when clapping back at a troll bashing him for posting a video of  his daughter. “You ran away to the edge of the world and married  three women, had 30 children. Deborah was struggling to pay her rent with your  own children. You aren’t fooling anyone,” an Instagram user wrote. “Take your medication and relax. I am in New York with my baby, OK,” Dumisani responded.
