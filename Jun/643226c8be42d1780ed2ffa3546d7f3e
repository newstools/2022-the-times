Life has said yes to Nomcebo Zikode and a new whip is what she needed to celebrate just how well her life has been going. The Bayabuza hitmaker took to  Instagram to share a clip  of her signing documents  for her brand new Range Rover. The star was rocking a white power suit and her hubby was there with her to celebrate their new  aquisition. “The big things, the little things and the things that make us realise how far we’ve come. I’m so happy that I am able to share this moment with my family and those closest to me,” she wrote. Her manager confirmed to TshisaLIVE  the new car was hers and not an ambassadorship deal. The past two years have been filled with milestones for the star. Her career has grown beyond SA borders and she held the  SA flag high during her solo tour in North America last year. Her  travels have been impressive, from Switzerland to Miami, Florida, Doha and more, the Jerusalema hitmaker  performed her hit single and other songs in her catalogue. She took to Instagram  to share an  interview  on American TV channel Americateve, showcasing her being handed  the keys to the city last year. “Commissioner Wardson and Joe Carollo honoured me on my first visit to America, to the state of Florida and to the City of Miami. I was  declared  a distinguished visitor and presented with the keys to the city,” she wrote, announcing the news to her fans. Though the song has earned her global fame, her legal battle over  royalties is  ongoing. It was confirmed  to TshisaLIVE that the matter is still pending. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, the vocalist said she was eager to show people  she is more than a singer. “I've been that person who loves to do other things besides music. So I knew from the get-go that I need to also do other things. Not that I get bored, but I want to explore things, I want to do other things, be it perfumes, clothing line, and maybe one day a hair line. I want to also show to young girls coming after me that it's possible.”
