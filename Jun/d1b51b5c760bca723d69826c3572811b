Transport minister Fikile Mbalula says  blocking  roads  equals economic sabotage. Mbalula was addressing a media briefing on Friday on the release of the accident report  on the Tshwane bus crash which claimed the lives of 15 people. During the briefing he also referred to the challenges facing the trucking industry. This comes after the truck drivers' blockade of the N3,  which links Johannesburg to Durban. Truck drivers  were protesting against the employment of foreigners as drivers, among other issues. Mbalula  said law enforcement agencies would have to come down hard on the perpetrators when agreements  in place  were infringed upon. His department has been engaging the trucking industry and other relevant role players since December 2021. These  include the ministers of labour and home affairs, truck owners, truck drivers, trucking associations and unions. Mbalula called on truck drivers to be patient and  work with them to allow the engagement process to run its course. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
