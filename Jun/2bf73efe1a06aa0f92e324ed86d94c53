The SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) will on Tuesday conclude  hearing oral evidence in the  investigative hearing into the July 2021 unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. The hearing is chaired by commissioner Andre Gaum. Commissioners Philile Ntuli and Chris Nissen are also members of the panel. “The commission will hear oral evidence from the social cohesion group. The sitting on  June 21  marks the close of the receipt of oral evidence,” it said. During the various sessions, the commission received a large  amount of written and oral evidence from affected community members, civil society organisations, experts and business organisations. The commission said in the previous session of the hearing President Cyril Ramaphosa recognised the importance of the probe and articulated his support for the process. Other members of cabinet,  including police minister Bheki Cele and former defence and military veterans minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, also  testified before the commission. Circumstances around the unrest in July last year implicated  basic human rights such as the right to security, the right to be free from all forms of violence, the right not to have one’s possessions seized and the right to life, the commission said. “The events which plunged the country into a crisis have had  direct impacts on human rights and long term implications for people and  the economic health of the country beyond the two provinces where the unrest occurred. “The probe by the commission as an independent constitutional body is therefore a necessary response allowing reflection on the causes, outcomes and responses during the  unrest with  a view to ensuring that a human rights crisis of such a nature does not again befall the country.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
