A 24-year-old KwaZulu-Natal man who was hijacked on Sunday  evening and  held  hostage for  more than 24 hours in multiple locations in Durban is said to be “resting and recovering” from his trauma. His father, Dr Elton Dorkin,  said  Chad had been driving  home after visiting a friend in his silver Toyota Yaris when he was  hijacked by three attackers. Dorkin said they were grateful for  the prayers and support of the community. “We are deeply appreciative of the Durban community which came together and supported us during this painful experience.” The hijack  sent shockwaves around the city.  After  police and private security efforts,  Chad was released and reunited with his family  in the vicinity of Queen Nandi Drive, north of Durban. “I can confirm that a ransom was demanded for his release. However, due to the ongoing police investigation we are unable to disclose any further details,” said Dorkin. Police spokesperson Const Thenjiswa Ngcobo confirmed the incident. She said Dorkin's friend, who had opened the case, had “alleged that on June 12 at  7.52pm they were on Woodford Road when they were accosted by three unknown people. [Dorkin], who was in the vehicle ... was kidnapped and hijacked by the suspects. Charges of kidnapping and carjacking  were opened  at Durban Central police for investigation”. Dorkin's car had not yet been found. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
