EFF leader Julius Malema  says the party  is not buying President Cyril Ramaphosa’s story that he was not involved in the controversies surrounding his Phala Phala game farm in Limpopo, where millions of dollars were allegedly hidden in furniture and then stolen with the help of a domestic worker. This is because, the red berets insist, nothing  could happen on a property owned by Ramaphosa without his prior knowledge and approval. Thus, the alleged torture of suspects who stole money from the farm and them being apparently paid hush money after the interrogation would have been known to Ramaphosa. Malema was addressing a press briefing at the EFF headquarters in Johannesburg on Tuesday. He said the party has sent parliamentary questions to Ramaphosa  about the incidents. The questions include: According to Malema, if Ramaphosa does not answer the questions to their satisfaction, the EFF will  disrupt his public speeches until he steps aside to allow for an investigation  into his involvement in the matter. “Fellow South Africans, we gave Ramaphosa a chance to prove himself and he has dismally failed. We will treat him the same way we treated Zuma,” he said. “He must leave  office with immediate effect because he has not respected his oath of office. Everywhere and anywhere were we find and see Ramaphosa and we have an opportunity to stop him, in the name of SA we will do so. “We will start on Thursday and will [go on]  forever until he lets go of that office. That office must be occupied by a man of integrity, not a hypocrite and a man with double personalities. We will not allow that.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
