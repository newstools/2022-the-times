I didn't cry while I was at school, I cried when I got home and the house was just quiet. It was just so weird without him. But he had a great day, his teachers kept sending us pictures, and he had the time of his life. Missed his pickup because I'm at work. It was so weird this morning because I was so really happy but also my heart was just sore,” she said on her Instagram stories.
