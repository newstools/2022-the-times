Space science, drones, emerging aviation tech and much more is on the menu as the International Flight Inspection Symposium (IFIS) 2022 lands at the Durban International Convention Centre from June 20-24. Hosted by the SA Civil Aviation Authority in collaboration with International Committee for Airspace Standards and Calibration, this year marks the first time in this biennial event’s history that it will be held on African soil.

This includes representatives from navigation service providers, aviation authorities, privately owned aviation-related companies and airport companies.
