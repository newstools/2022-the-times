Two suspects who allegedly tried to bribe a community activist to persuade the parents of a 10-year-old child who was raped to drop the charges will appear in the Phalaborwa magistrate's court on Monday. The two suspects, aged 30 and 40, were arrested on Friday. Limpopo police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspects, both foreign nationals, reportedly tried to bribe a local community activist in Namakgale, outside Phalaborwa, to influence the parents of a 10-year-old child who was allegedly raped by their  Bangladeshi friend to drop the charges. “The 10-year-old child went to the suspect’s shop in Namakgale on  May 8 at about 11am to buy an airtime voucher. Instead of serving her, the suspect locked the door and raped the child inside. He  then let her go,” he said. He said the rape was reported and the suspect was arrested  at his shop on the same day. The case against the accused was postponed to  June 20 for further police investigation. Mojapelo said the two suspects allegedly offered to pay the activist   to  use of his influence to convince the parents to withdraw the charges against their  countryman. “After paying a portion of the money, members of the provincial anti-corruption unit  pounced on the two suspects and arrested them,” he said TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
