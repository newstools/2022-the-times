Mamelodi Sundowns had a parade to show off their remarkable haul of trophies to their supporters in Tshwane on Wednesday. Sundowns completed a clean sweep of trophies in the recently wrapped up 2021-22 domestic season. The Tshwane giants won the DStv Premiership, MTN8 and most recently the Nedbank Cup as they took their PSL dominance to a new level. Sundowns have now won the league five times in a row and 12 times overall. The parade was attended by the club’s chairperson Thlopie Motsepe, who addressed the fans, technical team and players. The Chloorkop-based club collected a cool R40-million from winning the trophies and their Caf Champions League run that ended in the quarterfinals.
