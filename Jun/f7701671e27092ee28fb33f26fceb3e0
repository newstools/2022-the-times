There are continued calls by some for President Cyril Ramaphosa to step aside amid the “farmgate” scandal in which he is accused of concealing the theft of millions in cash at his Phala Phala farm in Limpopo. However, Ramaphosa told journalists on Friday  he will not step aside as this would  mean he is interfering with the ongoing investigation by police. “There could be a suspicion that I would interfere with the police and others. We have said we want police to investigate whatever crime, whoever it is against, without any fear or favour and on an impartial basis. “If I were to say I am stepping aside on that account, it would basically mean I am confirming I interfere in the investigation process, which I don’t,” he said. Suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said last week party officials implicated in wrongdoing must be treated equally. “Justice must have eyes for all of us and we are watching SA, we are watching the integrity committee of the ANC and we are watching the people of SA. “Allegations are allegations but when it was allegations against us, people said we are corrupt. Now I hear people defending themselves and I say we must be treated the same,” said Magashule. ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe defended Ramaphosa and dismissed claims  he stole money from taxpayers. He said the president was being persecuted for being a victim of a crime. “I love the idea that says the president of the ANC is not accused of stealing. The allegation is that his money was stolen. There will be processes that will culminate in a number of issues. Let’s say the SA Revenue Service, for example. We will wait for them to make a determination, but what are you taxed on when money is stolen?”  Mantashe asked during an interview with TimesLIVE.
