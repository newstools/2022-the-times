Employment and labour minister Thulas Nxesi says his department is finalising a policy to help regulate the extent to which foreign nationals can be employed in SA. Nxesi was responding to the blocking of roads by  truck drivers on the N3 highway in KwaZulu-Natal after drivers complained about jobs being taken by both legal and illegal foreign workers. The drivers complained that they were being overlooked by shipment companies in favour of  foreign national drivers. Nxesi said the government was committed to addressing the issues in a way that ensured the long-term viability of interventions, some of which would require a “longer runway”, owing to legislative changes. He said one of the key ways that government plans to address this is through the proposed National Labour Migration Policy (NLMP). The policy aims to achieve a balance across several areas, including: Nxesi said the department is   reviewing major recommendations to determine whether they require regulatory changes. “The department intends to complete synthesising the recommendations by the end of June this year, and then present a consolidated document at Nedlac for a formal consultation with social partners.” Nxesi said the NLMP goes hand-in-hand with a proposed Employment Services Amendment Bill, which provides a policy framework and the legal basis to regulate the extent to which employers can employ foreign nationals in their establishments while protecting the rights of migrants. He said the proposed amendments to the Employment Services Act aim to limit the extent to which employers can employ  foreign nationals in possession of a valid work visa. The act will codify the obligations of an employer engaging foreign workers, including; “We will not tolerate lawlessness in the form of road blocking. We urge law enforcement to unleash the full force of the law on those who use illegal means to express their grievances while undermining the rights of others,” Nxesi said.
