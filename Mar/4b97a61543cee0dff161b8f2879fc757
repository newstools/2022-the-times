Radioactive substances could be released from Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant because it cannot cool spent nuclear fuel after its power connection was severed, Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom said on Wednesday. Fighting made it impossible to immediately repair the high-voltage power line to the plant which was captured by Russian forces after the Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Energoatom said there were about 20,000 spent fuel assemblies at Chernobyl that could not be kept cool amid a power outage. Their warming could lead to "the release of radioactive substances into the environment. The radioactive cloud could be carried by wind to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Europe". Without power, ventilation systems at the plant would also not be working, exposing staff to dangerous doses of radiation. On Tuesday, the UN nuclear watchdog warned that the systems monitoring nuclear material at the radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl had stopped transmitting data. The still-radioactive site of the world's worst nuclear disaster is about 100km  from Kyiv. Its fourth reactor exploded in April 1986 during a botched safety test, sending clouds of radiation billowing across much of Europe. Reuters
