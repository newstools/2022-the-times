As South Africans eagerly await an announcement on amended Covid-19 regulations, conversations have turned to whether South Africans  will  continue to wear  masks in public if  not compelled to do so by law. This week DA and UDM leaders John Steenhuisen and Bantu Holomisa were vocal about the need to scrap mask-wearing. Steenhuisen said wearing masks should be reserved for high-risk areas  such as oncology wards in hospitals. He said this regulation was disruptive in schools as it prevented effective teaching and learning. “Like other countries, we need to licence cheap  rapid tests for home use so  people can judge for themselves if they pose a risk to the vulnerable. It makes no sense to limit these to medical supervision. “Like other countries, masks should only be mandated in high-risk contexts, such as oncology wards,” he said. On Sunday, Holomisa said it's time for masks to "fall". Epidemiologist and former chairperson of the Covid-19 ministerial advisory committee Prof Salim Abdool Karim said SA is ready to lift regulations on mask-wearing outdoors. “I don’t know what government’s plans are on wearing masks, but what we’ve seen from other countries is that we have reached a stage where we can change our overall strategy. We can remove most of our restrictions and public health measures at this point,”  he told eNCA. “For example, we can get away from all  the sanitising, we can drop our outdoor mask-wearing mandate but we  will probably need to keep  other things.” Last week health minister Joe Phaahla  said government stakeholders were deliberating  new regulations  to replace the national state of disaster when it is scrapped. The state of disaster is in place until March 15. It was initially implemented in March 2020 to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.
