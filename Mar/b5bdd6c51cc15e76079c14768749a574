Do human rights mean human rights for all or just for South Africans? On  March 21 1960 South African police gunned down unarmed anti-apartheid  activists gathered in Sharpeville, near Johannesburg,  who were protesting against the  pass law system. The massacre led  to the deaths of 69 people and at least 180 others  were seriously wounded. This moment in our history marked a turning point in the nation's struggle for freedom. Now every year  in March we celebrate Human Rights Day to commemorate what  it cost to secure equal basic human rights and dignity for all. While  many South Africans  don’t feel that their  human rights are protected and prioritised,  Africans living in our country, our neighbours,  feel they have been scapegoated and it is South Africans  who  are trying to strip them of their  human rights and dignity.Listen to the opinions of  South Africans, foreign nationals, journalists and experts, including advocacy director in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Carine Kaneza Nantulya, and executive director of Amnesty International SA, Shenilla Mohamed.
