The ANC Mpumalanga elective conference is being interdicted in court a day before it is meant to sit. ANC members Vilanculo Francisco and Edward Mahlangu have launched an urgent court interdict in a last attempt to stop the conference. In court papers dated March 31, the pair want the court to review and set aside the conference invitation sent out by provincial task team co-ordinator Lindiwe Ntshalintshali on March 22. Ntshalintshali and Mandla Ndlovu were appointed co-ordinator and convener of the task team along with others earlier this month when the ANC national working committee (NWC) dissolved the provincial executive committee. They were given a mandate to take the province to its next elective conference. The NWC said it had opted for the dissolution of the PEC after it failed to convene a conference since the departure of  then provincial chairperson David Mabuza. The province last held its conference in 2015. In their court interdict, Franscisco and Mahlangu argue that the appointment of the task team by the  NWC was unlawful as the structure does not have such powers. They want the court to declare that “only the NEC of the ANC has powers to dissolve the PEC structures of the ANC” and that only the NEC can therefore appoint a task team. Some of their requests to the court include: The road to the  conference has been rocky. Recently the provincial offices were set alight while some of its branch meetings have been marred by  violence. In terms of the conference, Ndlovu and Ntshalintshali are said to be front-runners for the influential positions of chairperson and deputy chairperson, while murder-accused Mandla Msibi is contesting the position of provincial treasurer. Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane is also said to be contesting the chairperson position. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
