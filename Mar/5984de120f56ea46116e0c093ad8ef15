Hundreds of foreigners  were forced to seek refuge in a community hall and a mosque at the weekend after clashes with residents of Zwelitsha at Bredasdorp in the Western Cape. At least 450 families were affected after their homes were damaged last week, the SABC reported on Monday. The Cape Agulhas municipality condemned the violence, adding  it had resulted in injuries, damage to property and displacement of people, especially the most vulnerable, women and children. “Since Thursday,  March 24,  arrests have been made and a large number of dangerous weapons were confiscated. “A strong police presence is in the area and the public order policing unit  has been deployed to Zwelitsha,” the municipality said on Saturday. Residents marched to the municipality last week to express  unhappiness  about an alleged influx of undocumented foreigners  to the area. The march comes on the heels of the Dudula movement rallying against foreigners  in other parts of SA. Discussions with community leaders  in Zwelitsha and foreigners to reach a peaceful agreement — with the assistance of religious leaders and the SA Human Rights Commission — at the end of last week were unsuccessful. “A collective decision was made that it would be safe for non-nationals to remain outside  Zwelitsha  to allow the elders of the Zwelitsha community to engage  the group over the weekend. Subsequently, the municipality is accommodating the displaced people.” The municipality  thanked people who  opened their hearts to  help with the provision of food, blankets and shelter. Zimbabwean community leader Givemore Nyakarimba told SABC News: “This is inhumane. We do not have anywhere else to go. We are stranded and we are calling for people to come to our rescue.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
