SA’s constitution is lauded as being one of the most progressive around the world. However, do the provisions it contains truly create the mechanisms for meaningful transformation and decolonisation? Or does the way it was negotiated and drafted create a barrier to these goals? If it’s the latter, does the constitution need to be changed before our society can be transformed? These and other compelling and pertinent questions will be  explored during the Constitution Hill Trust’s first “We, the People in Conversation” event of 2022, which will be live streamed from Constitution Hill in Johannesburg on March 17. Moderated by Adila Hassim, advocate and human rights activist, and featuring a conversation between esteemed panellists Dikgang Moseneke, honorary professor at the University of Pretoria and former deputy chief justice of the Constitutional Court, and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, advocate and author, this thought-provoking event will unfold along the themes of past, present and future. This event is a precursor to the 2022 Human Rights Festival, which is taking place from March 19 to 21 at Constitution Hill. For more information about the festival, click here.
