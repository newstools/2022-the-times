One SA Movement leader Mmusi Maimane has thrown shade at former president Jacob Zuma, saying he does not look to him as a moral compass. Maimane was weighing in on Mbali Ntuli’s resignation from the DA this week, when one user said  Zuma had told him he was being used in the DA but he didn’t listen. “The man who used taxpayers’ money to build a mansion for himself is not my moral compass,” Maimane clapped back. Maimane’s comment was in reference to Zuma’s controversial Nkandla homestead, which sparked controversy for a decade and was estimated to have cost more than R240m. Maimane also called for a change of leadership in the 2024 general elections, saying  the ANC and DA had failed to represent South Africans. He called the upcoming polls “the most important elections since 1994”. “ANC ayisafani ne DA ayisafani [The ANC and DA are no longer the same]. We need new vehicles to get to the change  this country deserves. One party is corrupt and incapable. The other is not cognizant of the value of building an equitable and diverse SA. One SA,” he said. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
