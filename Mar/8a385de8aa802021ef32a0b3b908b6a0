No Covid-19 deaths have been reported in SA in the past 24 to 48 hours. But the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said on Sunday night that due to “the ongoing audit exercise by the national health department there may be a backlog of Covid-19 mortality cases reported”. “Today, the department reports 0 deaths, as well as 0 deaths occurring in the past 24—48 hours. Total fatalities remain unchanged at 99,543 to date.” According to the NICD, 1,147 new Covid-19 cases have been identified in SA, which represents a 6.1% positivity rate. A question that has dogged scientists since Covid-19 first struck has been this: why do some people become severely ill and others have no symptoms at all? It was established early in the now-two-year-old pandemic that advanced age and certain comorbidities place some people at far higher risk than others when it comes to severe disease and death. But that was only part of the picture. Those two factors still didn’t explain why some perfectly healthy young people were getting very sick or dying, when other people with very similar health profiles, sometimes even in the same family, were whistling their way back to good health in just a few days.
