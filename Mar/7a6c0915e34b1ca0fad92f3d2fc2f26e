A culture of self-enrichment among some  South African politicians and public servants is putting democracy and post-apartheid promises of  a better life for all at risk, according to the most senior official at the National Treasury. “We have to remind our leaders — and I’m speaking as a South African — who are in government, in public service and politicians to get off your high horse and do what we have to do to ensure we create access and a conducive environment for people’s lives to change,” Treasury director-general Dondo Mogajane said on Thursday at a national budget dialogue. “If that’s not going to be a motivating factor, we can start calling SA  a failing state because the things that define a failing state are beginning to show, where we don’t care about the poor and improving their lives.” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com
