Olympic 200m breaststroke champion and record holder Tatjana Schoenmaker was the biggest winner at the SA Sports Awards ceremony on Saturday night as she walked away with the coveted Sports Star and Sportswoman of the Year awards. The 24-year-old Schoenmaker, who also bagged a silver medal in the 100m breaststroke at the 2020 Olympic Games in Japan, beat strong competition in both categories. The other major winner on the night at the International Convention Centre (ICC) in Durban was Springbok winger Makazole Mapimpi who was named the Sportsman of the Year. During the period athletes were judged on, Mapimpi helped the Springboks to the World Cup title in Japan with a win over England and a hard-fought 2-1 series win over the British and Irish Lions. In other categories, Pieter du Preez, who won a gold medal in the men's H1 cycling time trial at the Tokyo Paralympic Games, was named Sportsman of the Year with a Disability.
