While many taxpayers lost their jobs and businesses  to the Covid-19 pandemic, ministers and deputy ministers were splurging on luxury vehicles. The Sunday Times reported ministers and their deputies  spent roughly R19m  on luxury vehicles. This came to light after  government departments provided the information in response to questions from the DA. From the response, it emerged that the government splurged taxpayers’ money on 24 luxury vehicles for 17 ministers and deputy ministers between 2019 and 2021. Some of the vehicles cost more than the R700,000 spending limit imposed in the November 2019 version of the ministerial handbook. The handbook was amended to introduce a R700,000 cap on ministerial vehicles but was later increased to R800,000 by a Treasury directive. These are the cars ministers, former ministers and deputy ministers bought: Ministers Deputy minister Former ministers DA MP Leon Schreiber slammed the ministers for buying “flashy new wheels” while “poverty, hunger and hardship exploded all around them”. “While every other citizen feels this pain every day at the taxi rank, fuel pump and cash register, there is one elite class of South Africans who are exempt from the cost of living crisis facing our country — the very ANC cabinet that caused the poverty crisis in the first place,” said Schreiber. Speaking to Sunday Times, Dlamini-Zuma’s spokesperson, Mlungisi Mtshali, said the department made an application to the Treasury for permission to purchase her vehicle. “We did submit a request to the minister of Treasury at that time and the approval was granted,” said Mtshali. He said the car did not have any extras. “We made the request based on the type of travel that she does to municipalities. You will find that she doesn’t rent cars, she drives across the country,” he said.Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
