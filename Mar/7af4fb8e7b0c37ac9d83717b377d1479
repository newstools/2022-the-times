Three people have been arrested after the Louis Botha statue  at the main entrance of parliament was vandalised on Wednesday afternoon. DA MP Joe McGluwa was nearby  when the incident happened. "I was on my way to a sitting  of questions for oral reply Cluster 3 which includes the presidency. I was  shocked to witness heated arguments with the police," said McGluwa. "At about 14:42 this afternoon,  police spotted the trio  with a ladder, grinder and generator near the statue," said police spokesperson Col Athlenda Mathe. "Members of the SAPS moved in swiftly and managed to confiscate the items. During a scuffle between  police and the trio, one of the male suspects managed to spray paint as well as vandalise the statue with a hammer. "All three have been arrested and charged with malicious damage to property, resisting arrest as well as the assault of police officers." This comes after a National Assembly building was burnt down in an alleged arson incident on January 2. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
