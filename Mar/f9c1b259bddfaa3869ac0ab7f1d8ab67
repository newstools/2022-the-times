On Wednesday the SA Human Rights Commission  (SAHRC) continues its investigative hearings into the July 2021 unrest and looting in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. On Tuesday military chief Gen Rudzani Maphwanya  suggested the defence force was not prepared for the  unrest. The commission is investigating the unrest which erupted after  the jailing of former president Jacob Zuma. Mass looting and destruction of businesses ensued  and more than  300 people lost their lives during the turmoil. Maphwanya claimed  the  military did not have intelligence before the unrest,  and moved to clarify that what they did have  were unsubstantiated claims and  information. TimesLIVE
