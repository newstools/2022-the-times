An administrative building in Kharkiv, located in the city’s Freedom Square, was struck by Russian missiles, bringing the ongoing conflict closer to residential areas. The footage, released on  Tuesday and shown above, shows the moment the building exploded in flames. Firefighters can be seen combing the rubble after the attack. This latest incident comes as the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its sixth day. Talks between Russian and Ukrainian diplomats yielded no results and Russian  forces continued to bomb areas of Ukraine as the talks unfolded. On Monday, the UN Security Council held a special meeting on the  conflict in which Ukraine’s UN envoy Sergiy Kyslytsya put the blame for the conflict squarely on Russia’s shoulders. “This war was not provoked. It was chosen by someone who is right now sitting in the bunker,” he said. Kyslytsya also compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler, the German  dictator who lead the world into a global conflict in 1939.
