SA has declined to condemn Russia’s unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine, a decision that has baffled some, but it need not. It is the government version of the ANC’s support for Putin’s Russia at this critical moment. There are two books I believe every South African who participates in discourse on SA’s foreign policy should make time to read. They provide historical accounts that illuminate the ANC and its government’s confused and somewhat baffling position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The first is The Hidden Thread: Russia and South Africa in the Soviet Era by former Soviet academics Irina Filatova and Apollon Davidson. The second is External Mission: The ANC in Exile by the late Dutch academic and former editor of Africa Confidential, Stephen Ellis. Both are excellent accounts of how, over the many decades of the struggle against apartheid, the ANC’s world view took shape and metastasised to what it is today. Whether we like it or not there is a hierarchy of suffering in the world. Some suffering gets more attention. Some bodies get more sympathy. Some of us do not even qualify for the Olympics of suffering because we are seen as incapable of undergoing it. You can only be at the suffering Olympics if the gatekeepers recognise you as fully human. What does Africa want? Over the past two weeks, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has unfolded, we have seen a confused, inconsistent, uncoordinated and hapless Africa stagger from being a cheerleader for one superpower or the other, while failing to ask and answer the most crucial question: what do Africans and humanity in general have to gain from this?
