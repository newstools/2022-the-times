An elderly man lost his life after agreeing to sell animal feed to men who arrived at his Delmas, Mpumalanga farm, even though he was initially reluctant because it was Sunday. The attackers allegedly strangled and killed Gustav Rappard, 76, then went into the house where they tied up his wife and ransacked the house. They got away with nothing except the couple’s cellphones. A search for the suspects has been launched. “The suspects should be hunted down and  brought to book within a short  time. It is  a disgrace that suspects target defenceless victims,” said Mpumalanga police commissioner Lt-Gen Semakaleng Daphney Manamela. Provincial police spokesperson Brig Selvy Mohlala said the couple heard  hooting at  their gate at about 11am on Sunday. “The man  went outside to check and the wife reported  she saw six males who indicated  they were there to buy grass bales.” He told them  it was Sunday and he could not help them. He returned to the house but moments later had a change of heart and  told his wife  he had decided to assist them. “The suspects are alleged to have then  strangled the old man,” Mohlala said. His body was later found in a barn. Four of the suspects  entered the house where they demanded  cash from the  wife. She was tied up  after she told the assailants  they did not have cash, said Mohlala. They went through the house searching for moneyand left with two cellphones.
