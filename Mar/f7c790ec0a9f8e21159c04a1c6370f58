The body of a 14-year-old school pupil was found at the Vryburg cemetery in the North West on Sunday. The North West department of education says  police are investigating the cause of the teenager's death. Family members of Sedika Lekhobo (Mereekae) reported that they last saw her alive when she left home on Saturday afternoon. MEC for education, Mmaphefo Matsemela, conveyed her condolences to the bereaved Lekhobo and Mereekae families. "On behalf of the department l would like to convey our sincere condolences to the bereaved families of our learner who attended school at Vryburg Secondary School. The pandemic of gender-based violence against women and children is  rife  in our communities. We  hope police  will find those responsible for her death." Meanwhile, a mobile classroom was burnt out at Namusa Primary School in Ipelegeng  near Schweizer-Reneke on Sunday afternoon, with  damage estimated at almost R180,000. Department spokesperson Elias Malindi said the fire  destroyed the  classroom, desks and chairs, textbooks and workbooks. “It is alleged that the community residing near the school saw the mobile classroom  had caught fire within the school premises. They called the fire department and  tried to extinguish the fire.” The cause of the fire is being investigated and  a case of arson has been opened with the  police. "It is disappointing that on the same day  we celebrate  Human Rights Day  we experience a violation of the  right to education," Matsemela said. "The department is hampered by those opposed to progress in  the education system. Learners have lost a lot of teaching time due to Covid-19 lockdown and while we try to reverse the losses some people continue to sabotage the good efforts of the department."
