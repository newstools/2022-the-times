The disciplinary process against  SA Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has sparked debate after it emerged that  one of the charges brought against him was for carrying a gun when attending meetings. Vavi was asked to explain why he should not be suspended. Saftu president Mac Chavalala said guns are a “sensitive issue” and Vavi’s actions had made some feel uncomfortable. Vavi responded, saying no leader had raised their discomfort with him before and that he only carried a firearm when his close protector was absent. “The national office bearers, led by the president, had refused to get the services of someone who was willing to be employed on a stipend, using resources as an excuse, when the issue openly said  the president wanted to have a protector too. “The national executive committee in response  had asked the national office bearers to get a company to do a security assessment risk on each of the national office bearers and Saftu properties to determine if there is a security threat to any  national office bearers. This was not done for obvious reasons,” Vavi said. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
