The SA Human Rights Commission will on Monday convene the first sitting of an inquiry into racial discrimination in the advertising industry. Activist Zulaikha Patel was the first to testify at the inquiry. This comes after  controversies such as the  Tresemmé shampoo advert, which depicted blonde women's hair as “normal”, and black women's as “frizzy and dull” in 2020, and another in 2018 when H&M apologised for an advertising image featuring a black boy modelling a hoodie with the slogan “coolest monkey in the jungle”.
