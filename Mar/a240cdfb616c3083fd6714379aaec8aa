Eskom COO  Jan Oberholzer says the power utility is facing a logistical nightmare trying to keep the lights on. Eskom  is  spending millions transporting and burning millions of litres of diesel to keep its open-cycle gas turbine (OCGT) stations operational. The stations, Ankerlig and Gourikwa, are meant to be operated during peak periods but have been used more frequently since load-shedding started earlier this week. Oberholzer told a press briefing that the power utility was burning through 9-million litres of diesel a day. This meant that one diesel shipping container, which carries about 30-million litres of diesel, would only last three days. The diesel needs to be transported inland by road, making the process a logistical nightmare. Oberholzer apologised for the effect  load-shedding was having  on the economy and called on Eskom staff to “keep focused and get through this  very trying period”. TimesLIVE
