Im out!.' I don't know if we'll be ayt Riky. The load is sooo heavy. “All these pictures and memories are f*cking me up cause I thought we had a chance to create more in good time. Every morning is harder than the last. There's so much I wanted to tell you, I don't know if it means anything now. I am going to miss you ma dawg.” he wrote. On Wednesday, the rapper took to his Instagram stories saying he was struggling to come to terms with Ricky's death. “I've experienced a lot of kindness and love this week, I appreciate every message and every gesture as I am clearly not OK. I've cried and cried but I am yet to come to terms with this. I have to say this though, it's all in God's hands and all shall be well with our shoulds. God moves.”
