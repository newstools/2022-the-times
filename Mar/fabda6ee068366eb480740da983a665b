Mpumalanga premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane has committed to beefing up security  at the home of renowned Ndebele artist  Esther Mahlangu, who was robbed and assaulted last week. A team had been assembled to asses security at Mahlangu's home and compile a report on what needs to be done to improve it. "If the report says warm bodies are needed here to secure the home, the provincial government will make sure  it happens." She  appealed for patience as police  searched for the suspect. Mtshweni-Tsipane said she was confident an arrest would be made soon. "The police are on the trail of the suspect and we urge him to hand himself over. Everyone is a suspect in this case, including family members," she told media at Mahlangu's home on Wednesday. She  said Mahlangu was recovering  from her ordeal. Community safety MEC Vusi Shongwe condemned the crime and appealed to community members to ensure they  are part of local policing structures. "Policing is not just the responsibility of police. There are structures  such as the community policing forum (CPF). Residents need to be part of such structures so  they can help police  fight crime. If you  look at the number of residents in Siyabuswa and the number of  police stations, you can see  the ratio doesn't correspond. Police will not be able protect all residents on their own." An experienced team of detectives has been assigned to work on the case, he said. "I can assure you  we will arrest the suspect, no matter how long it takes, but eventually the perpetrator will be brought to book."
