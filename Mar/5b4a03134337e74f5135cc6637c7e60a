We condemn Russia and we stand firmly with the people of Ukraine,” he said. EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu said the party stood with Russia and President Vladimir Putin. “There is nothing wrong with the Russian Federation preventing the military expansion of Nato, which is trying to expand its presence to the borders of the Russian Federation. “We should strengthen our relationship [with Russia] because it is based on common prosperity and anti-imperialism,” said Shivambu.
