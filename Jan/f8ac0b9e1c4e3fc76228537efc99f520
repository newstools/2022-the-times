The National Liquor Traders Council has bemoaned the impact a glass bottle shortage has had on taverns in SA. The shortage is said to be caused by difficulties resulting from the alcohol bans, buoyant growth in the beverage industry after the ban was lifted, and the suspension of the Consol Glass Nigel plant in Gauteng. Speaking to eNCA, National Liquor Traders Council spokesperson Lucky Ntimane said the shortage has affected taverns badly. “The situation we are facing is very dire because Consol can only supply  90% to 95% of the required glass for the alcohol industry,” he said. There are  rations on the  number of cases   that can be ordered , with the industry only set to return to normal in May. “If you order 10 cases, you may not get  10. You may get one or two if you are lucky. That means we’re going to suffer for the next four to five months,” said Ntimane. IOL reported that Consol Glass CEO designate Paul Curnow said the glass bottle shortage was worsened in certain products where demand or additional growth had exceeded historical offtake. “In the short term, Consol continues to assist all its customers by facilitating imports of glass where feasible,” said Curnow. Last year, Ntimane told SABC News  the informal liquor sector was struggling to recover from the  alcohol bans  that were implemented during lockdown. “The supply chain issues being experienced by liquor manufacturers affect us directly because without stock we are not able to run our businesses,” he said. ” That there aren’t any glass bottles available  for products such as Savanna and others means  our recovery efforts are going to take time. We won’t be able to sell  stock since it’s not available.”
