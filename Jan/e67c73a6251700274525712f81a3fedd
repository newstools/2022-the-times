Paul Makaula appeared in  the Hillbrow magistrate’s court on Friday for allegedly breaking  windows at the Constitutional Court  in Johannesburg with a hammer, causing about  R50,000 in damage. He was on parole for  a murder committed in 2010. The 36-year-old  was arrested on Wednesday and charged with malicious damage to property. He has been remanded in custody and the case was postponed to March 25 for further investigation. On Wednesday national police spokesperson Lt-Col Robert Netshiunda said  police were called in the morning after a man was found breaking the windows. When officers arrived, the man was  busy with his attack. Netshiunda said he did not stop smashing the windows until police fired a warning shot.  TimesLIVE
