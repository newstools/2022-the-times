It's very rare in the rap game that compliments get passed around among MCs but Sjava consistently proves there's no need for beef. He came to AKA's defence when a tweep was low-key shading him for his rap line “Hey, Lekker Lekker Fish And Chips” from the song Fela in Versace. The shade came after a fan tweeted that the rapper was a conscious rapper. “AKA is lowkey a conscious rapper, Dude spit thoughtful sh*t and make you do research on things just so you could fully understand a line/bar,” the tweep wrote. Sjava retweeted the line and applauded AKA for being conscious of his surroundings. “This is actually one of the most conscious things I have ever heard in SA hip-hop don’t forget @bennimccarthy17 was the one who said this and @akaworldwide as a coloured person to include it in his Raps means he is conscious of his surrounding Google the meaning of CONCSIOUS.” Sjava had a tough time explaining what conscious rap was, because tweeps were lost that he could conclude from that line alone that AKA was a conscious rapper. A fan told the rapper to avoid getting into debates with tweeps who don't know Mzansi music history.
