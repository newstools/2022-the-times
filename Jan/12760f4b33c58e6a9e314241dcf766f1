Karl Toko Ekambi scored a double as hosts Cameroon comfortably beat lowly-ranked Gambia 2-0 in Saturday’s Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinal to become the first side to book a place in the last four. The two goals came in a seven-minute burst in the second half as Cameroon finally converted their superiority into goals in front of an ecstatic crowd at the Japoma Stadium. Toko Ekambi got his first with a 50th-minute header and then, in the 57th, snuck in behind the Gambian defence to tap home a square pass for the second. Cameroon will meet the winner of the Sunday's quarterfinal between Egypt and Morocco.
