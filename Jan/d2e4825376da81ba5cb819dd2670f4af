While experts have told us to social distance and sanitise, how do we protect ourselves from getting Covid-19 if we share a toilet or tap with others? The Western Cape government has issued some advice on the best way to keep yourself safe when using a community toilet or tap. This includes: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there is little to no chance of contracting Covid-19 from drinking water. It said the virus has not been found in water supplies, and water treatment destroys the virus. “The risk coronaviruses pose to drinking water is considered to be low and the Sars-CoV-2 virus has not been detected in drinking water. “Drinking water treatment methods neutralise infectious pathogens  in the water. Sars-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, which means it has a fragile fatty envelope that is easily destroyed by the treatment process. Therefore, treated drinking water does not pose a risk for Covid-19.”
