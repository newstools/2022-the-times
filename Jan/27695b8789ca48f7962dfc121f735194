Former public protector Thuli Madonsela has welcomed the release of the state capture commission's report to the public on Tuesday, not long after President Cyril Ramaphosa  received it. Ramaphosa received the first part of the report at the Union Buildings from the chairperson of the commission, acting chief justice Raymond Zondo, on Tuesday. The first portion of the report  covers a number of areas, including investigations into SA Airways. Madonsela said on Twitter the release to the public accorded with SA's constitutional value of accountability. Following the release of the report, executive secretary of the Council for the Advancement of the SA Constitution, Lawson Naidoo, said it was yet to be seen whether the statement made by Ramaphosa when receiving the report — that this was a defining moment in the country’s effort to end the era of state capture — would come to fruition. Naidoo told Newzroom Afrika  it  would only mark the start of the end of this culture of corruption and impunity   if the recommendations  contained in the report were implemented swiftly. He said the way state institutions  were manipulated for nefarious ends had to stop. This would  depend largely on the political will to implement  Zondo's  recommendations. Zondo said those  who have been implicated needed to be  investigated further and on weighing the evidence, prosecuted if necessary. TimesLIVE
