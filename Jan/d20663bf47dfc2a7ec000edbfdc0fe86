Egypt booked a quarterfinal place at the Africa Cup of Nations with a 5-4 shoot-out victory over Ivory Coast after a goalless draw on Wednesday as substitute goalkeeper Mohamed Abo Gabal saved a casual penalty from Ivorian defender Eric Bailly. Abo Gabal pushed the penalty on to the crossbar from Bailly’s weak attempt as seven-time winners Egypt set up a quarterfinal with north African rivals Morocco at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaounde on Sunday. It was a lively match at the Japoma Stadium in Douala in which both sides created enough chances to win the game, but also at times lacked quality in the attacking third at either end in another largely quiet outing for Egyptian captain Mohamed Salah. Egypt are seeking their first continental title since 2010 having surprisingly fallen at the last-16 stage on home soil in 2019.
