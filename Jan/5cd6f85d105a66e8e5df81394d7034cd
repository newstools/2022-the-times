She took to Instagram to share how people on the blue bird are a little too toxic and  encouraged people to let the haters hate. “Here's what I'm thinking. We all go through a lot, and of late on social media particularly On Twitter the blue birds  are  such a toxic environment. But for whatever it is  you are going through, please trust me because I've been going through a sh*t storm in the past few weeks. F**k everything  these people have to say on social media about you. They don't know you, literally. Find something to be thankful for. Thank me later.” Watch the video below:
