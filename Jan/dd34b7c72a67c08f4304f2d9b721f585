The lights went out at the ANC's gala dinner while President Cyril Ramaphosa was  thanking the business community for  its financial support. Before the lights abruptly went off, Ramaphosa was  expressing his gratitude to those who had stood with the ANC. “Apart from signifying your financial support by being here, this is proof that you still have trust in the ANC. We thank you for helping the ANC achieve sustainability and stability — for having the courage to come tonight to be associated with the ANC,” he said. Ramaphosa had just assured business that economic recovery plans were afoot and that the ANC renewal project was not just a pipe dream. The president had also admitted that the ANC NEC was concerned about security breaches that have led to the destruction of institutions such as parliament. He was whisked out by his security and the deputy president David Mabuza and national chairperson Gwede Mantashe also left. Electricity was restored  15 minutes later. This is a developing story.
