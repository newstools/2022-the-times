SA observed above normal rainfall over  almost the entire country from mid-December last year. The rain  continued into the first 20 days of January over the larger part of the country, with the exception of most  coastal regions. “The wetter than normal summer rainfall season so far can mostly be ascribed to the presence of the La Niña event,” the SA Weather Service said. It said the  event was predicted to weaken towards the end of  summer. The service said in the most recent set of seasonal rainfall predictions both locally and internationally, the expected rainfall over SA for the remainder of this summer indicates enhanced probabilities for below-normal rainfall over the summer rainfall region.
