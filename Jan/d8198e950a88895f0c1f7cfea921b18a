The previous survey from January 3 showed Omicron responsible for 81% of cases. “In Italy on January 17, the Omicron variant was predominant, with an estimated prevalence of 95.8%, while Delta was at 4.2% of the sample tested”, the Institute said in a statement. The analysis is based on 2,486 swabs tested in 124 laboratories and collected in all 21 Italian regions and autonomous provinces, it said. Worldwide, according to this week's World Health Organisation report, the Omicron variant accounts for 89.1% of cases, while Delta accounts for 10.7%.
