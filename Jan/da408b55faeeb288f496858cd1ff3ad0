Thought you  could bag a fancy Smeg kettle for R60 from Takealot? Think again. Takealot has refuted social media claims that it is selling  retro Smeg kettles for less than their R2,359 asking price. This comes after  a social media user shared a picture of  a kettle with Takealot.com branding to “plug” her followers. The e-commerce company  said the claim was a scam. It also rubbished a similar claim that it is selling  vacuum cleaners for R60. Takealot said it was aware of the scam making the  rounds on social media, and  recommended  customers do not engage with it in any form. “Please note  this is not official communication and we strongly recommend  you do not engage with this in any form. If you come across any suspicious communication, please feel free to reach out to us to validate its authenticity,” it said. Takealot said it previously warned its customers about such scams and there is nothing it can do beyond that. “We're aware of this page and have done ‘warning posts’ on our social media before. However, there’s unfortunately not much we can do other than to warn our customers to stay vigilant. It is clear from the link and URLs in the screenshot  this is not Takealot’s official communication.” The company said it will not  issue refunds to those who have been scammed, and advised  people to report the matter to the  police. “We advise you reach out to your bank to stop your card, create a new one and report the matter to the police,” it said. On social media, many reacted to the scam and warned others to not fall victim to it. Here's a snapshot of what they said:
