In this riveting live discussion, contributor and analyst for TimesLIVE, Eusebius McKaiser, is joined by senior investigative journalist at the Sunday Times, Sabelo Skiti, and advocate Nicole Fritz, director of the Helen Suzman Foundation, to unpack the findings contained in the first report  from the state capture  inquiry. The first part of the report was released on Tuesday afternoon. Was the state capture  inquiry worth the time, effort and money  poured into it, or was the inquiry chaired by acting chief justice Raymond Zondo yet another waste of  state resources? To engage live, add your comments in the YouTube comment section. Listen to previous episodes of Eusebius on TimesLIVE here.
