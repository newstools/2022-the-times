Sweden will compensate those households which have been worst hit by a surge in electricity prices, Finance Minister Mikael Damberg said on Wednesday, with the government setting aside 6 billion crowns ($664.45 million) for measures. The government said it would cover three months from December 2021 with a maximum amount of 2,000 crowns per household per month. The government said the money would reach around 1.8 million households. "These are exceptional measures for an exceptional situation," Damberg told a news conference. Electricity prices have surged in Sweden in recent months - particularly in the south of the country - though the increases have been less marked than in many other parts of Europe. Sweden's electricity comes mainly from its own hydro-power, nuclear reactors and wind power installations and it does not rely on imports of natural gas. However, prices are set on international markets, meaning Swedish consumers have also been affected.
