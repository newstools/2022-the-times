Your daughter, our first Princess Sehlora Alicia, #yourphotocopy now, she was five months old when you left us in this world. She will be tuning 11 on  March 15 2022. “While a little piece of my heart went to heaven along with you, I smile through the tears and heartache. You, my sweet son, brought me so much happiness in your short time here,” she wrote. Candy said though it was hard to come to terms with his death she was comforted by the fact  he is in a better place. “Your little princes, family and your friends wish you happy heavenly birthday son. If anyone asks how I feel right now I'll definitely say I'm OK and know you are safe in God's kingdom.”
