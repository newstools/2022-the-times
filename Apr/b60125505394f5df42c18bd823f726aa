The death toll of school pupils who  died in  torrential rains that caused flooding and mudslides in KwaZulu-Natal  is at 17. That's according to provincial education department spokesperson Sihle Mlotshwa, who told TimesLIVE on Thursday that one  teacher died and 248 schools were damaged  in the devastating floods since Sunday. On Thursday, co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka said the official death from the floods is 306. One of the pupils who died  in a mudslide was grade 5 Gelofte Skool pupil Julia Fourie. In a post on Facebook, her school said Julia, her mother Marinda and grandmother Hester Grobler died in a mudslide at their home. More than 500 schools were forced to close  after the heavy rainfall as schools were flooded or access was blocked. Mlotsha said many flood-damaged schools were inaccessible and the department had asked school officials to be cautious and advise parents to  keep their children at home until  schools were fully operational and accessible. Many schools  could only be assessed on Tuesday next week as they were  now working on principal evaluations. Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu will visit affected communities in the uMgungundlovu municipality, including parts of Sobantu and Edendale, on Thursday.
