The health department has extended the deadline for public comment on the proposed Covid-19 regulations to April 25. According to health minister Joe Phaahla, the extension comes after comments  from several stakeholders that a 30-day period  was not sufficient time  to scrutinise  all sets of proposed regulations and  develop substantial representations. He urged interested individuals and organisations to use the extra time  for public comment on the health regulations meant to manage Covid-19 and other notifiable conditions outside the Disaster Management Act. People can send their comments to tsakani.furumele@health.gov.za. The department announced additional communication methods to send comments, including via  WhatsApp on  0600 123456 and email legalreviews@health.gov.za. The department acknowledged a technical glitch in which a few emails were erroneously deleted during their transfer  from an individual inbox into an open source, but said these were retrieved and included  for consideration and auditing. “We  assure everyone that all comments received will be accounted for,  recorded and considered,” said the department.
