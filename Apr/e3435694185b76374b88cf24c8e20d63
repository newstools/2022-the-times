Mike Tyson has been filmed allegedly beating  a passenger on board a flight after the fan reportedly harassed the former heavy weight world boxing champion. Tyson first took a selfie with two men, one of whom was sitting behind the boxer. However, after being pestered by the passenger, Tyson told the man to “chill”.  When the passenger continued, Tyson allegedly turned around in his seat and pummelled the passenger, leaving him bloodied. Tyson’s representative  said the passenger threw a water bottle at the boxer and would not stop harassing him. Tyson walked off the flight after the altercation.
