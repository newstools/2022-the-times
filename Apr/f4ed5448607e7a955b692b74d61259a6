Tourism minister Lindiwe Sisulu has called on tourists and residents in KwaZulu-Natal to be vigilant and safe after the floods that left thousands homeless and hundreds dead. Sisulu on Thursday sent her condolences to those who lost loved ones during the devastating floods in the province. The extreme weather  left a trail of destruction, leaving many without homes and hundreds without employment as businesses were affected, including a number of tourism and hospitality establishments. Sisulu said this week’s floods would cost the tourism industry millions in revenue and hundreds of jobs. She said a number of tourists had cancelled reservations because of  the heavy rains and floods, with some establishments badly damaged and others destroyed. “I am appealing to all who are travelling over the Easter weekend to do so safely and return to their homes safely,” she said. Sisulu said the country’s borders remained open and SA was ready to welcome visitors from  all over the world. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
