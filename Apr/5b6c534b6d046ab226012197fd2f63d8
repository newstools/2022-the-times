Six armed hostage-takers who held staff at a supermarket in Sundumbili on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast were nowhere to be found when police  entered the building. The  police task force and K9 unit  and private security officers  surrounded Boxer Cash and Carry on Monday morning when staff were taken hostage,  but the  men managed to escape. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Brig Jay Naicker said Sundumbili police were called out to an armed robbery at the supermarket  in the early hours of the morning. “It is alleged that as  staff members were arriving for work this morning, they were held up by a group of  about six  men armed with rifles and pistols. They  forced seven of the staff members into a cold storage facility. These staff members managed to free themselves and escaped after police arrived.” Police officers from the special task force, tactical response team and other specialists  entered the building looking for the  robbers. “They  found another three staff members hiding in the building. They were  not harmed and  were released by police. Police are still looking for the armed men,” Naicker said. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
