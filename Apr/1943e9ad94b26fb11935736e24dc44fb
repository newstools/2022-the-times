Two people were arrested in connection with the attack  on renowned African artist Esther Mahlangu at her home two weeks ago,  Mpumalanga premier  Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane said on Thursday. Speaking outside Mahlangu’s home in Weldervrede near Siyabuswa, the premier said police had been working around the clock to catch the suspects. She said the first person who was arrested allegedly had the firearm belonging to Mahlangu and she led them to the person he allegedly bought it from. The two men will be appearing in the Mdutjana magistrate’s court in Siyabuswa on Friday morning. During the robbery last month, Mahlangu, 86, was  assaulted and had her hands tied with a cord. The suspect then searched her bedroom and took a safe containing a 7.65mm pistol,  an undisclosed amount of cash and bundles of keys, then fled the scene. Mahlangu was left helpless and  had injuries on her face. She was later found by her granddaughter, who alerted  neighbours. “We are happy as government that police have apprehended the suspects. When we reported  this to gogo (grandmother), she was happy that justice  was being done,” the premier said. Mtshweni-Tsipane said Mahlangu  wanted to attend the court case so she could see who had attacked her. Mtshweni-Tsipane said  Mahlangu was “in high spirits” when the government team met her on Thursday afternoon. However, she said, Mahlangu was not happy with what happened to her. “It had a psychological effect on her. What is of comfort to her is that justice has been done and she is surrounded by family members. As we were briefing her  on developments she had  a sense of relief that something was being done,” the premier said. In a statement, police said the two suspects  were charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm and house robbery. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
