The winning and finalist images in the inaugural Photo Awards, presented by Jägermeister in partnership with the Sunday Times and Sowetan, will be showcased at the FotoZA Gallery in Rosebank, Johannesburg, until April 6 2022. The five category winners were announced on April 1, along with five "Wild Card" winners. The category winners are Pierre van Rooyen (Fashion), Rob Brown (Design), Naledi Mathebula (Portrait), Vahid Davids (After Dark) and Kegopotswe Ramafoko (Phone Photography: Street).  The winners in the Wild Card category – for judges' favourites that lost out on public votes – are Itumeleng Boikhutso (Design), Ezzie Benjamin (Fashion), Lwando Nteya (Phone Photography: Street), Lance James Daniel (Portrait), and Anton Wannenburg (After Dark). This category was sponsored by Instax Mini-Evo instant film camera from Fujifilm, an innovative, analogue-style camera. FotoZA is a photographic gallery and coffee shop based in Rosebank Mall. It exhibits work by both well-known fine artists and up-and-coming photographers. It is also home to Kameraz, the photographic store catering to a range of photographic needs. The Photo Awards exhibition includes printed images of all the finalist and winning entries, along with magazine covers, printed by ZAP!, which is also situated in the Rosebank Mall. The winners were decided in a public vote for the top five finalists in each category selected by the competition's award-winning judges: The exhibition is open to the public 9am–5pm on weekdays. Visitors to the FotoZA Gallery will also have an opportunity to enjoy another new exhibition, Dogs Unleashed by Emma O’Brien. This exhibition will offer pet-friendly weekends for visitors to bring their dogs to FotoZA for special treats and photo shoots.
