The body of a girl, believed to be about six years old, was recovered at the foot of uMzinyathi Falls, north of Durban, on Tuesday. The child is one of 448 people who died when  heavy rain flooded parts of the province,  displacing 40,000 people and  disrupting about 16,672 households. Search and rescue teams continue to scour riverbeds and valleys for at least 72 people  still missing. A rescue team comprising of police, the K9 unit  and  Gift of the Givers members  were deployed to uMzinyathi Falls on Tuesday morning to search for bodies which may have been washed down river. Her body was discovered among broken trees and flattened bush on the river bank. Due to the treacherous terrain, an SANDF helicopter was called in to hoist the child's body to the top of the valley. At least six people are believed to be missing in the immediate vicinity. About 48 police  teams from around the country have been deployed to  help in recovery operations. Efforts to locate those unaccounted for have been bolstered by the deployment of  SANDF personnel after a state of  disaster was declared   by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Twelve SANDF rescue teams are stationed in the province to assist in delivering food parcels and searches. Damage to infrastructure is estimated to cost  billions of rand.
