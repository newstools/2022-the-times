The SA ‘A’ men’s team will undertake an outbound white ball tour to Zimbabwe from April 25 to May 10, Cricket SA (CSA) and Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) confirmed on Friday. The tour will comprise three ODIs and five T20 matches in Harare. “It is pleasing to us that our SA ‘A’ team will soon be back in action. The ‘A’ team is a vital part of the CSA high performance programme and a stepping stone to the Proteas team,” said CSA CEO Pholetsi Moseki. “With a bumper international season coming up, it is important for us to have a healthy pipeline, filled with players who are ready and able to take their place in the senior national team if and when called up. “It all starts in the ‘A’ team and I’m certain that this tour to Zimbabwe will shine a spotlight on the great potential that we boast as a nation. We look forward to supporting coach Malibongwe Maketa and his charges as they embark on this very necessary tour and wish them all the best.” Schedule Zimbabwe XI v SA ‘A’ 1st ODI: April 25, Harare Sports Club 2nd ODI: April 27, Harare Sports Club 3rd ODI: April 29, Harare Sports Club 1st T20: May 2, Harare Sports Club 2nd T20:  May 4, Harare Sports Club 3rd T20: May 6, Harare Sports Club 4th T20:  May 9, Harare Sports Club 5th T20: May 10, Harare Sports Club
