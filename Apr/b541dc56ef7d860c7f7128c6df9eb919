Former DA MP Phumzile Van Damme has praised the EFF's efforts to  promote democratic reforms in Eswatini. The red berets held a protest this week  urging King Mswati III to embrace  democracy. “Thank you EFF for keeping the spotlight on Eswatini. Great work on this, fighters,”  Van Damme said. “Continuing to highlight the plight of the people of Eswatini living under a brutal dictatorship is  admirable. Ubuntu — love for thy neighbour is who we  are as Africans. Do not let the loud voices of a few xenophobes destroy this. “Intellectual maturity — being able to see bad and still be able to see good. On this, the EFF has done good,” said Van Damme. EFF head of international relations Godrich  Gardee  said Mswati's days as the country's monarch  were numbered and the nation was "not the king's village". Meanwhile, EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi rejected the idea that the people of Lesotho are not part of SA. “Even apartheid could not keep that  border, it never worked. The point is a fence between you and Mosotho has nothing to do with jobs, Eskom or crime. You need to take the fight to ANC. That’s your problem.” Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
