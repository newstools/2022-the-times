Marc Jury,  SuperSport CEO, said: “Thomas is more than a world-class broadcaster. He is the epitome of professionalism, known as much for his insight as his warmth and good humour. We can’t wait to see him back doing what he does best.” Mlambo said he was pleased to return to the pay channel. “SuperSport is where I began as a sport TV presenter and this opportunity to return is extremely exciting for me. “I look forward to reconnecting with viewers across the African continent and to be part of one of the world's biggest sports broadcasters.” TimesLIVE reported this week that Mlambo would return to SuperSport.
