Four police officers suspended after the fire in parliament earlier this year have been redeployed to other areas. The four officers, who were on duty when the fire broke out in January, were suspended as investigations were under way into the blaze that  gutted  the National Assembly. Lt-Gen Sam Shitlabane, head of protection and security services, told  parliament's police portfolio committee on Wednesday  they  had  been moved from parliament. Zandile Mafe has  been arrested and is accused of  starting the fire. He faces criminal charges at the Cape Town magistrate’s court. Shitlabane was asked about the investigation into the fire and an  audit of national key points. “The investigation is ongoing. However,  I can report  that  [police] on duty at 100 Plein Street,  have been redeployed to  stations outside the protection [services] as well as the captain  who was on duty, the relief commander.” “We have had a discussion with public works and infrastructure” on whether the  National Assembly  building will   be fixed. Parliament’s leadership has been trying to find a new venue and had even considered using a marquee inside the parliamentary precinct.
