At a time when many people would be planning to head  to the coast for the Easter break, KwaZulu-Natal has been devastated by flooding that destroyed homes and  infrastructure and killed dozens of people. Torrential rain and landslides have hit the area since Sunday night, displacing hundreds. Relief and rebuild efforts (to which you can contribute here) have been under way since. The  disaster may have an effect on local tourism with the Easter holidays  among the busiest  in the province. However,  KwaZulu-Natal chairperson  of the Federated Hospitality Association of Southern Africa, Brett Tungay, told TimesLIVE hotels, lodges and guest houses  are still expected to be  busy. “There will be an effect, especially this close to the Easter weekend. Members have noted some cancellations on the southern coast, but these are not large  numbers.” There had been no reports of severe damage to hotels and resorts and he expected clean up operations would be finalised before the start of the long weekend. The biggest issue may be access to properties booked and debris on the beaches, but  local government was working hard to restore services, repair infrastructure and clean up tourist areas, Tungay said.
