Operation Dudula has long held that it is neither  a  xenophobic nor a violent movement and that it is being  misrepresented by the media and certain politicians. Listen to what they had to say: Operation Dudula again formed a major feature of SA’s news cycles after  a death in Pimville,  Soweto, on Monday. A group of people, allegedly South African residents of Pimville   and Operation Dudula members from the community, marched on Monday to protest against continuous power outages due to cable theft. The group alleged  they could trace the theft to a group of undocumented foreign nationals who live in the area. During a  march to confront the foreigners, Kgomotso Vincent Diale, a father of two, died in circumstances which are under police investigation. Following Diale’s death, Operation Dudula leader Nhlanhla “Lux” Dlamini addressed residents, reiterating that the organisation and the people are not vigilantes  and have been misbranded by media houses. In an attempt to allow Operation Dudula to clarify its mission, aims and purpose, TimesLIVE allowed  national executive member and representative Nango Enoch to outline  its intentions and debunk misconceptions spread by the media. * Please note that the views in this piece do not necessarily reflect the organisation or creators of this work.
