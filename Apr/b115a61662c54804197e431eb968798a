DA leader John Steenhuisen on Monday slammed President Cyril Ramaphosa after corruption-accused former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede was elected ANC eThekwini regional chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal. Steenhuisen said the return of embattled Gumede to a powerful position in the  province proved  Ramaphosa has lost control of this  region and others. Steenhuisen, whose party filed a no-confidence motion against members of Ramaphosa’s cabinet earlier this year, said the president needs to regain control of the ruling party. “With corruption-accused Zandile Gumede  elected as ANC eThekwini regional chairperson last night, and with her allies  having won all the other top positions contested, Ramaphosa has clearly lost control of this and other key regions. But he can and must control the size and composition of his cabinet,”  Steenhuisen said. Gumede’s election was met with mixed responses from politicians and the public. EFF secretary-general Marshall Dlamini laughed off the losses  by Ramaphosa’s allies, while former Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus welcomed Gumede’s election. Gumede, who was nominated and elected in absentia, beat Ramaphosa’s ally Thabani Nyawose for the position. TimesLIVE reported her victory is expected to give corruption-accused former health minister Zweli Mkhize a much-needed boost in his contestation for the ANC presidency  at the December elective conference. The controversial former mayor faces more than 2,000 charges relating to a R320m solid waste project. She was elected alongside Thembo Ntuli as deputy chairperson, Musa Nciki as regional secretary, Nkosenhle Madlala as secretary and Zoe Shabalala as treasurer. Ntuli, Madlala and Nciki, are the  only members of the five who are not facing  corruption charges. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
