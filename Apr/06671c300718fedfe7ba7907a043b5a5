The Mpumalanga High Court on Monday sentenced Siphesihle Jeremia Mashabane, 28, and Kgomotso Cecil Khoza, 27, to life imprisonment for the murder of an attorney in 2015. The court  convicted the  duo of murder,  robbery with aggravating circumstances and theft. On  December 16 2015, Mashabane and Khoza  followed Xolani Govern Sithole, 26, to his house in Barberton, where they attacked him with a hammer. They took his keys, unlocked his house and dragged him  inside. They fled with his cellphone and wallet. Sithole, who worked for Legal Aid SA,  died of his injuries. His assailants were arrested the  next day. They  pleaded not guilty and implicated each other in court. Judge Thando Mankge found no substantial and compelling circumstances to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence. She sentenced each  to life imprisonment  for premeditated murder, 15 years  for robbery with aggravating circumstances and three years for theft. The  sentences will  run concurrently.
