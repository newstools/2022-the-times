Baduvile Zungu’s eyes were opened to the sheer wrath of Mother Nature when her family narrowly escaped with nothing more than their lives on Monday night. The 74-year-old grandmother and her children lost all their belongings when waves of muddy water and debris gushed through their informal settlement in Ntuzuma, north of Durban, destroying everything in their wake and leaving them completely exposed to the elements. Zungu’s plight was brought about after torrential downpours in KwaZulu-Natal since Sunday, which have killed at least 45 people — including seven children — and left hundreds displaced. Seated on a thin mattress inside a community hall in Ntuzuma, Zungu recalled the force of the water which, in a matter of seconds, swallowed all their possessions and left them destitute. Just a month ago, Business Times brought the good tidings that investor confidence in KwaZulu-Natal was returning after being battered in the wake of the July violence, with activity in Durban’s logistics and industrial property market gaining momentum. In the past two days, a very distressing picture has started to emerge, one that could dash hopes that the province is on the road to economic recovery. Widespread floods are wreaking havoc across the length and breadth of the province, from KwaDukuza in the north to Margate in the south. Images of collapsed roads, sinkholes and washed-away bridges have flooded social media platforms after torrential rains started on Monday night.
