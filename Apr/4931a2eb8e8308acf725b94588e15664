The rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations and population immunity are  among the factors that contributed to  the lower severity of the Omicron variant which dominated the fourth wave of the pandemic. Health minister Joe Phaahla told parliament on Friday the department expected the pandemic to be less demanding of financial and other resources than it was in the past two years. Phaahla was presenting the department’s annual performance plan and budget for the 2022/23 financial year. He said the highly transmissible Omicron variant was more easily manageable compared to previous strains due to the availability of vaccines and increased population immunity. Phaahla said in 2022/2023 the department will focus on its programmes  which could not be carried out at the height of the pandemic. The minister  said there were “worrying concerns” about an increase in positive Covid-19 tests which  is being closely monitored. "We hope  even if there is a rise in infections during winter, it will not be disruptive enough to divert us from our programmes,” said Phaahla.
