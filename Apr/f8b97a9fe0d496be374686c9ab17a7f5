The department of employment and labour's inspectorate in Limpopo has  banned the use of some classrooms at a primary school where cracks pose  a threat of potentially deadly collapse. Concerned parents lodged a complaint early in April about “unsafe classrooms” with cracks  visible from  inside and outside Kgwatlhele Primary School outside Mokopane. A notice for a reactive inspection was  served on the school principal. The department said  parts of the building were “prohibited” based on these findings: “Subsequent to the prohibition notice issued, the department of basic education was also issued with a contravention notice for failing to conduct a hazards identification and risk assessment, failing to ensure that the electrical installation is done safely by a competent person,  and not producing a copy of the certificate of compliance (COC) for electrical installation as it is a legal requirement to assure the building users and inspectors that the installation is safe,” the department said. Acting provincial chief inspector Reckson Tshishivheli said: “The department is aware of the impact that the closure may have on the curriculum,  but the specialist prohibited the school blocks in the interest of safeguarding  lives which is more important than education. “Our inspectors are mandated to protect the lives of people and we are serious about enforcing  health and safety legislation. “We encourage the public and employees who find themselves in  hazardous situations to bring it to the attention of the department for inspections to be conducted. The department has zero tolerance for non-compliance and will  prioritise the health and safety of  people in  the public and private sector.” Prohibited sections of the school will stay closed until the department of basic education corrects the non-compliance issues.
