After 23 years at the helm of the SA Communist Party (SACP),  general secretary Blade Nzimande will not contest for another term  at the July 2022 national congress. Nzimande revealed this during a media engagement session at Cosatu House in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. He said he felt  he had overstayed his welcome in the position he has occupied since 1998. However, he would remain a dedicated member and veteran of the party in its mission to “build socialism now”. Nzimande said: “I will no longer be general secretary [after July] so you will deal with the new general secretary. “I am not quitting the SACP, but I am not standing. It is too long to have one person occupying that position.” Nzimande’s decision not to avail himself in July opens the door  for long-time SACP deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila to occupy  the hot seat. It is unclear at this stage whether Mapaila will  face a challenger or be uncontested. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
