Police have launched a manhunt after an attack on security guards who were robbed of their firearms outside a mine in Virginia, Free State, on Tuesday night. Virginia police were informed about a shoot-out and a business robbery at Harmony Central Plant  about 11.30pm. “Apparently seven armed robbers attempted to hijack a Toyota Quantum driven by security personnel while patrolling outside the mine premises,” police spokesperson Capt Stephen Thakeng said. Though no-one was injured during the shoot-out, the suspects robbed the security officers' rifle and 9mm pistol and drove off with unknown vehicles. TimesLIVE
