Newly appointed national police commissioner Gen Sehlahle Fannie Masemola says the immediate priority  is  to build and strengthen community-police relations and  change the  negative public perception of the police. There is also a need to  improve morale and the integrity of  police officers who have a constitutional duty to serve and to protect communities. Speaking on Friday at his first media briefing  after being appointed  on Thursday, Masemola  listed  safety and security issues  he intended to focus on. These include: Also high on the agenda will be  advanced and refresher training of members, as  the SAPS embraces international policing standards. “This is over and above the entry-level training, such as the one that will commence soon for  12,000 new recruits,” he said. Another concern  was the damage to critical infrastructure and extortion at construction sites. “A dedicated capacity has already been established in this regard and we will be dealing decisively with crimes in relation to critical infrastructure and illicit mining.” Police will  intensify  efforts to reduce cash-in-transit heists and other aggravated crimes, he said. Police minister Bheki Cele said  there was an urgent need to rebuild the trust relationship between communities and the police. “This will be a legacy that will benefit not only the organisation, and the criminal justice system, but  the country for  generations to come,” Cele said. Masemola  was no stranger to the police, having joined  as a young recruit in 1990, he said. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
