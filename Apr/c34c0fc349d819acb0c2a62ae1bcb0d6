ActionSA leader Herman Mashaba and Eastern Cape chairperson Athol Trollip were on the receiving end of criticism on social media after Trollip shared that he gave  a supporter  a pair of shoes. He said the man’s shoes “fell apart” after canvassing for the party in East London three weeks ago. He said  gifting the man with shoes shows  Action SA “delivers on its promises”. “This gentleman’s shoes fell apart while canvassing in East London three weeks ago and I promised him a pair of shoes. ActionSA delivers on its promises,” he tweeted on Wednesday. Tweeps were far from impressed. Some asked why Trollip took the picture and shared it publicly, while others were not impressed with the “used” pair of shoes. He responded to critics, saying he did not take the picture. Mashaba sang Trollip’s praises for giving the man  “dignity” and encouraging him to change his circumstances.
