A video of alleged flood donor aid theft from Durban's Virginia airport which has gone viral is "fake news". The City of eThekwini  said a video posted on social media on Monday in which a donor recorded city officials in a van,  a truck  and a police vehicle carrying water was misleading. In the video, recorded by a woman who arranged humanitarian relief to be distributed to communities after  floods  ravaged the province, said she was notified that city officials were "stealing" truckloads of aid. She said she had parked her car in front of the municipal vehicles, preventing them from driving off and sought clarity  from officials. The city said  it was aware of the video. "The driver was not stealing. She is one of our employees in the community participation unit and is assigned to deliver donation to one of the townships. "We can  confirm reports that some  residents are insisting that  donated goods be delivered to areas of their choice and typically the areas they dictate are not the most  affected." It was "unfortunate" that the employee's reputation was tarnished and  and the public should  stop spreading fake news. Zain Soosiwala  of the Active Citizens Coalition told TimesLIVE  he  contacted the municipality to clarify the contents of the video. They told him  city officials were sent to Virginia to collect aid for affected residents temporarily housed at community halls. Soosiwala said he was told that due to a lack of communication  between  stakeholders the donor decided to take a video "claiming the city is stealing" while police and other stakeholders were told the relief was meant for the city. The video comes  amid concern by civic bodies that government should ensure the funds and aid allocated to the  flood disaster efforts are not stolen or misused.
