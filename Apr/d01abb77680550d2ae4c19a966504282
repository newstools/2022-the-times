Fans of musicians Cassper Nyovest and NaakMusiq are  eagerly awaiting their boxing match  at Sun City  this weekend. During a press briefing last week the two said they were  prepared. In fact, the Baby Girl singer is already at the venue and has been vocal about his preparation on social media. “So here we are. Sun City! It all comes down to this. Another historical moment for  SA entertainment. [The] whole team [is] ready. Time to put on a show!” he tweeted earlier this week. Fans who don't  want to spend the whole weekend at the venue can  buy day passes  which will give them access to the boxing match. Naak told TshisaLIVE he was doing work behind the scenes. “Cassper is comfortable, he knows what he's doing, he's been doing it for quite some time, so we figured it was a great thing. Let us work behind the scenes, create a monster and reveal it on the  night of the fight,” he said. Cassper's fought YouTuber and entertainment commentator Slik Talk earlier this year, knocking him out. He told TshisaLIVE  he hoped to revive boxing in SA. “I feel like boxing in SA is dead. We had world champions in the country who people don't know about. I felt like if I put my name on it, it would help everybody,” said the rapper.
