A L’Oréal hair relaxer has been recalled after complaints from 22 consumers that it causes scalp irritation and hair breakage. Certain 125ml tubs of Dark and Lovely Precise Diamond Straight and Shine relaxer must be returned to the shop where they were bought for a full refund, the National Consumer Commission said on Saturday. “We understand that an isolated incident in the production led to an imbalance of the active raw material, affecting one batch only,” said acting consumer commissioner Thezi Mabuza. She said L’Oréal had informed the commission about a voluntary recall of batch numbers 87UD00 and 87UD01. They were  distributed nationally as well as in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini, Zambia and Madagascar. “The Consumer Protection Act requires that manufactures and producers of products produce and supply goods and products are of good quality and free of defects,” said Mabuza. “We urge suppliers and manufactures to prioritise consumer safety at all times. The commission is monitoring the recall based on its recall guidelines.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
