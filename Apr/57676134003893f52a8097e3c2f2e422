Due to further unit failures and continued delays in returning  units to service, stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented continuously from  5am on Wednesday  to 5am on Friday, says Eskom. The power utility said the extension is caused by the failure of additional units and the continued shortage of generation capacity due to delays in returning to service three generating units at Camden power station and two  at Tutuka. “Overnight a generation unit each at Medupi, Matla, Kendal and Komati power stations failed while 240MW of power imports from Mozambique  were interrupted, exacerbating the supply constraints. Three generation units were returned to service at Matla, Grootvlei and Camden power stations,” it said. Eskom said it currently has 5,379MW on planned maintenance, while another 14,827MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned breakdowns. The power utility said the extension of  outages is required to preserve the remaining emergency generation reserves in an attempt to limit the stage of load-shedding. “Eskom would like to inform the public that any further deterioration in generation capacity may require further load-shedding. Eskom would like to apologise for the implementation of load-shedding and  reiterate that load-shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We will communicate should there be any significant changes to the supply situation,” it said. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
